### Abstract
Assessing and evaluating programmatic outcomes of graduate education programs help stakeholders understand and respond to challenges that emerge over the course of a complex academic program. Given the increased complexity of program activities and outcomes, there is a need for semi-automatic, interactive visual analytics tools that transform data into actionable insights to inform decision-making. This paper documents the results of the evaluation planning and annual workflow setup to create dynamic assessment reports for the Complex Networks and Systems NSF Research Traineeship (CNS NRT) program at Indiana University. The CNS NRT evaluation workflow relied on institutional, survey, and publication data and the freely available tools to guide decision making and communicate the achievements of faculty and doctoral trainees who participated in the program between 2017 and 2024. The evaluation data to date show that the program is judged by participants as meeting its goals and that there has been considerable evidence of research productivity as indicated in the publication data. These clear gains in short-term outcomes show that the CNS NRT is on a pathway to achieving the medium and longer-term goals of the project, which will be examined over a longer period.

### Evaluation Data
Evaulation data is provided in three folders: _"data"_ is used for original data sets, _"analysis"_ is used for analysis results generated by the evaluation scripts, and _"supporting information"_ provides information and data related to the assessment. Data is furthur described in the [Data Manifest](https://github.com/cns-iu/cns-nrt-evaluation-supporting-information/wiki/Data-Manifest).

### Code, Libraries, and Data Preparation Tools
Statistical analysis was performed in R and R Studio. Analysis relied on the following the packages:
* _magrittr_ was used for piping data frames.
* _tidyr_ & _plyr_ were used for data manipulation and munging.
* _dplyr_ & _reshape2_ for data summarization.
* _stringr_ was used for string manipulation
* _bib2d_f was used for conversion of BiBtex files to CSV. 
* _igraph_  was used for creating networks in R.
* _ggplot2_, _patchwork_, _grid_, & _gridExtra_ were used for data visualization, & _ggnetwork_ was used for network visualizations.

Additional data preparation tools used include:
* _Endnote x20_ was used to manage publication data collected from NSF Reporter, Google Scholar, and Web of Science.
* _Open Refine_ (v3.9.2) was used to disambiguate author names for CNS NRT co-authorship network analysis.
* _Gephi_ (v0.10.1) was used to generate network layout coordinates for the CNS NRT co-authorship network analysis.
