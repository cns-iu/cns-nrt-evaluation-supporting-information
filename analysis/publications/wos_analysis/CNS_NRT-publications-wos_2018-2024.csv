This study aims to examine the drug-drug interaction (DDI) phenomenon with a large-scale longitudinal analysis of age and gender differences found in drug administration data from three distinct healthcare systems.Methods This study analyzes drug administrations from population-wide electronic health records in Blumenau (Brazil; 133 K individuals), Catalonia (Spain; 5.5 M individuals), and Indianapolis (USA; 264 K individuals). The stratified prevalences of DDI for multiple severity levels per patient gender and age at the time of administration are computed, and null models are used to estimate the expected impact of polypharmacy on DDI prevalence. Finally, to study actionable strategies to reduce DDI prevalence, alternative polypharmacy regimens using drugs with fewer known interactions are simulated.Results A large prevalence of co-administration of drugs known to interact is found in all populations, affecting 12.51%, 12.12%, and 10.06% of individuals in Blumenau, Indianapolis, and Catalonia, respectively. Despite very different healthcare systems and drug availability, the increasing prevalence of DDI as patients age is very similar across all three populations and is not explained solely by higher co-administration rates in the elderly. In general, the prevalence of DDI is significantly higher in women - with the exception of men over 50 years old in Indianapolis. Finally, we show that using proton pump inhibitor alternatives to omeprazole (the drug involved in more co-administrations in Catalonia and Blumenau), the proportion of patients that are administered known DDI can be reduced by up to 21% in both Blumenau and Catalonia and 2% in Indianapolis.Conclusions DDI administration has a high incidence in society, regardless of geographic, population, and healthcare management differences. Although DDI prevalence increases with age, our analysis points to a complex phenomenon that is much more prevalent than expected, suggesting comorbidities as key drivers of the increase. Furthermore, the gender differences observed in most age groups across populations are concerning in regard to gender equity in healthcare. Finally, our study exemplifies how electronic health records' analysis can lead to actionable interventions that significantly reduce the administration of known DDI and its associated human and economic costs.","[Sanchez-Valle, Jon; Lepore, Rosalba; Valencia, Alfonso] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Life Sci Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Correia, Rion Brattig; Rocha, Luis M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, 2780-156 St, Oeiras, Portugal; [Camacho-Artacho, Marta] Agencia Espanola Medicamentos & Prod Sanitarios, Madrid, Spain; [Lepore, Rosalba] Basel Univ Hosp, Dept Biomed, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Lepore, Rosalba] Univ Basel, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Mattos, Mauro M.] Univ Reg Blumenau, Blumenau, Brazil; [Rocha, Luis M.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Valencia, Alfonso] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; University of Basel; University of Basel; Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB); State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY; ICREA","Sánchez-Valle, J; Valencia, A (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Life Sci Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Correia, RB; Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, 2780-156 St, Oeiras, Portugal.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;Valencia, A (corresponding author), ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain.",jon.sanchez@bsc.es; rionbr@gmail.com; rocha@binghamton.edu; alfonso.valencia@bsc.es,"Correia, Rion/ADD-1721-2022; Mattos, Mauro/H-8438-2013","Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [PID2022 141809OB I00, PTDC/MECAND/30221/2017]; Fundaco para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [R01 LM012832]; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine [R01 LM011945]; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine [R01 LM011945, 1735095]; Fulbright Commission fellowship; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems [2022.09122.PTDC]; Fundaco para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; [RTI2018 096653 B I00]","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Fundaco para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); Fulbright Commission fellowship; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems; Fundaco para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia;","J.S.V. was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (RTI2018-096653-B-I00 and PID2022-141809OB-I00).

Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes and biases, the integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social contagion remains an open challenge. In particular, studies on social phenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex, rather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical evidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion dynamics-from simple to complex-simultaneously. Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion-resistance-can come about from cognitive mechanisms.","[Aiyappa, Rachith; Flammini, Alessandro; Ahn, Yong-Yeol] Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Aiyappa, R (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",racball@iu.edu,"Ahn, Yong-Yeol/C-6334-2011","Ahn, Yong-Yeol/0000-0002-4352-4301; flammini, alessandro/0000-0003-1670-9156; Aiyappa, Rachith/0000-0002-0802-8994",National Science Foundation NRT grant [1735095]; DARPA [HR001121C0168],National Science Foundation NRT grant; DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),"R.A. was partially funded by National Science Foundation NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

This emerging field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields. Further collaboration will help address difficult issues in oncology such as limited data availability, requirements of model transparency, and complex input data which are embraced in a mechanistic learning framework Data and knowledge both drive the progress of research and are the cornerstones of modeling. Depending on the emphasis, both data-driven (exemplified by machine and deep learning) and knowledge-driven (exemplified by mechanistic mathematical modeling) models generate novel results and insights. Mechanistic learning describes approaches that employ both data and knowledge in a complimentary and balanced way.","[Metzcar, John; Macklin, Paul] Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Intelligent Syst Engn, Bloomington, IN USA; [Metzcar, John] Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Informat, Bloomington, IN USA; [Jutzeler, Catherine R.; Bruningk, Sarah C.] Eidgenoss TH Zurich ETH, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol D HEST, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jutzeler, Catherine R.; Bruningk, Sarah C.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat SIB, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kohn-Luque, Alvaro] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo Ctr Biostat & Epidemiol, Oslo, Norway; [Kohn-Luque, Alvaro] Oslo Univ Hosp, Oslo Ctr Biostat & Epidemiol Res Support Serv, Oslo, Norway",Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Brüningk, SC (corresponding author), Eidgenoss TH Zurich ETH, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol D HEST, Zurich, Switzerland.;Brüningk, SC (corresponding author), Swiss Inst Bioinformat SIB, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"Macklin, Paul/LWI-5233-2024",,"NSF [1735095]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PZ00P3_186101]; Cancer Moonshot funds from the National Cancer Institute, Leidos Biomedical Research [21X126F]; Indiana University Luddy Faculty Fellowship [237718, 332645]; Botnar Research Center for Child Health Postdoctoral Excellence Programme [PEP-2021-1008]; ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PZ00P3_186101] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Cancer Moonshot funds from the National Cancer Institute, Leidos Biomedical Research; Indiana University Luddy Faculty Fellowship; Botnar Research Center for Child Health Postdoctoral Excellence Programme; ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In processes of cell migration, the ECM also acts as a scaffold, providing structural support to cells as well as points of potential attachment. Although the ECM is a well-studied structure, its role in many biological processes remains difficult to investigate comprehensively due to its complexity and structural variation within an organism. In tandem with experiments, mathematical models are helpful in refining and testing hypotheses, generating predictions, and exploring conditions outside the scope of experiments. Such models can be combined and calibrated with in vivo and in vitro data to identify critical cell-ECM interactions that drive developmental and homeostatic processes, or the progression of diseases. In this review, we focus on mathematical and computational models of the ECM in processes such as cell migration including cancer metastasis, and in tissue structure and morphogenesis. By highlighting the predictive power of these models, we aim to help bridge the gap between experimental and computational approaches to studying the ECM and to provide guidance on selecting an appropriate model framework to complement corresponding experimental studies.","[Crossley, Rebecca M.; Johnson, Samuel; Yin, Yuan] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Wolfson Ctr Math Biol, Oxford, England; [Tsingos, Erika] Univ Utrecht, Inst Biodynam & Biocomplex, Computat Dev Biol Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bell, Zoe] Newcastle Univ, Northern Inst Canc Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Berardi, Massimiliano] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, LaserLaB, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Berardi, Massimiliano] Optics11 life, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Botticelli, Margherita] Univ Birmingham, Watson Sch Math, Birmingham, England; [Braat, Quirine J.

These contacts are known to mediate the spread of an infectious disease; however, it is not obvious how the properties of the spreading process are determined by the structure of and the interrelation among the group settings that are at the root of those recurrent interactions. Here, we show that reshaping the organization of groups within a population can be used as an effective strategy to decrease the severity of an epidemic. Specifically, we show that when group structures are sufficiently correlated, e.g., the likelihood for two students living in the same dorm to attend the same class is sufficiently high, outbreaks are longer but milder than for uncorrelated group structures. Also, we show that the effectiveness of interventions for disease containment increases as the correlation among group structures increases. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our findings by taking advantage of data about housing and attendance of students at the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. By appropriately optimizing the assignment of students to dorms based on their enrollment, we are able to observe a twofold to fivefold reduction in the severity of simulated epidemic processes.","[Patwardhan, Siddharth; Rao, Varun K.; Fortunato, Santo; Radicchi, Filippo] Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Rao, Varun K.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Patwardhan, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",,"Radicchi, Filippo/B-4407-2009; Patwardhan, Siddharth/KVY-5923-2024; Fortunato, Santo/C-3586-2009","Rao, Varun/0009-0008-7704-1974; Fortunato, Santo/0000-0002-9039-4730; Patwardhan, Siddharth/0000-0002-7355-355X; Radicchi, Filippo/0000-0002-8352-1287","Army Research Office [W911NF-21-1-0194]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-19-1-0391, FA9550-21-1-0446]; National Science Foundation [1927418, 1735095]",Army Research Office; Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This project was partially supported by the Army Research Office under Contract No. W911NF-21-1-0194, by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grants No. FA9550-19-1-0391 and No. FA9550-21-1-0446, and by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 1927418 and No. 1735095.

While powerful, this approach is limited by the inability to assess higher-order interactions involving three or more elements directly. In this work, we explore a method for capturing higher-order dependencies in multivariate data: the partial entropy decomposition (PED). Our approach decomposes the joint entropy of the whole system into a set of nonnegative atoms that describe the redundant, unique, and synergistic interactions that compose the system's structure. PED gives insight into the mathematics of functional connectivity and its limitation. When applied to resting-state fMRI data, we find robust evidence of higher-order synergies that are largely invisible to standard functional connectivity analyses. Our approach can also be localized in time, allowing a frame-by-frame analysis of how the distributions of redundancies and synergies change over the course of a recording. We find that different ensembles of regions can transiently change from being redundancy-dominated to synergy-dominated and that the temporal pattern is structured in time. These results provide strong evidence that there exists a large space of unexplored structures in human brain data that have been largely missed by a focus on bivariate network connectivity models. This synergistic structure is dynamic in time and likely will illuminate interesting links between brain and behavior. Beyond brain-specific application, the PED provides a very general approach for understanding higher-order structures in a variety of complex systems.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Pope, Maria; Faskowitz, Joshua; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.; Puxeddu, Maria Grazia; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pope, Maria; Faskowitz, Joshua; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,"Puxeddu, Maria/L-1614-2019","Pope, Maria/0000-0001-6717-7132",NSF-NRT [1735095],NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"We would like to thank Dr. Caio Seguin for valuable discussion throughout the process.

However, dynamic models have yet to widely incorporate one of the most important insights from communication models: the brain may not use all of its connections in the same way or at the same time. Here we present a variation of a phase delayed Kuramoto coupled oscillator model that dynamically limits communication between nodes on each time step. An active subgraph of the empirically derived anatomical brain network is chosen in accordance with the local dynamic state on every time step, thus coupling dynamics and network structure in a novel way. We analyze this model with respect to its fit to empirical time-averaged functional connectivity, finding that, with the addition of only one parameter, it significantly outperforms standard Kuramoto models with phase delays. We also perform analyses on the novel time series of active edges it produces, demonstrating a slowly evolving topology moving through intermittent episodes of integration and segregation. We hope to demonstrate that the exploration of novel modeling mechanisms and the investigation of dynamics of networks in addition to dynamics on networks may advance our understanding of the relationship between brain structure and function.","[Pope, Maria; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pope, Maria; Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Seguin, Caio; Varley, Thomas F.; Faskowitz, Joshua; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Pope, M (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Pope, M (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",popeme@iu.edu,"Seguin, Caio/AGH-1246-2022","Seguin, Caio/0000-0001-9384-6336; Pope, Maria/0000-0001-6717-7132",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [2240777]; NSF-NRT grant [1735095]; 16 NIH Institutes and centers [1U54MH091657],National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-NRT grant; 16 NIH Institutes and centers(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Clinical Center (CC)),"M.P. is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. 2240777.

One can adopt existing labels to express belonging to a certain community or introduce new labels to express an individual sense of identity. In such a process of co-creation, the existing identity labels of a community shape one's sense of identity, while individual expression changes that of a community. Social media has introduced new opportunities to study the expression of collective identity. Here we study the group behavior of individuals defining their identities with hashtag self-labels in their Twitter profiles from mid-2017 through 2019. These timelines of personal self-labeling show behavior incorporating innovation, conservation, and social conformity when defining self. We show that the collective co-labeling of popular concepts in the context of identity, such as #resist and #maga, follow the dynamics of a modified Yule-Simon model balancing novelty and conformity. The dynamics of identity expression resemble the collective tagging processes of folksonomies, indicating a similarity between the collective tagging of external objects and the collective labeling of ourselves. Our work underpins a better understanding of how online environments mediate the evolution of collective identity which plays an increasingly important role in the establishment of community values and identity politics.","[Barron, Alexander T.

One of the most well-established tools for modeling the brain is the functional connectivity network, which is constructed from pairs of interacting brain regions. While powerful, the network model is limited by the restriction that only pairwise dependencies are considered and potentially higher-order structures are missed. Here, we explore how multivariate information theory reveals higher-order dependencies in the human brain. We begin with a mathematical analysis of the O-information, showing analytically and numerically how it is related to previously established information theoretic measures of complexity. We then apply the O-information to brain data, showing that synergistic subsystems are widespread in the human brain. Highly synergistic subsystems typically sit between canonical functional networks, and may serve an integrative role. We then use simulated annealing to find maximally synergistic subsystems, finding that such systems typically comprise approximate to 10 brain regions, recruited from multiple canonical brain systems. Though ubiquitous, highly synergistic subsystems are invisible when considering pairwise functional connectivity, suggesting that higher-order dependencies form a kind of shadow structure that has been unrecognized by established network-based analyses. We assert that higher-order interactions in the brain represent an under-explored space that, accessible with tools of multivariate information theory, may offer novel scientific insights.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Pope, Maria; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.; Faskowitz, Joshua; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pope, Maria; Faskowitz, Joshua; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,,,NSF-NRT [1735095]; Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems,NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems,"T.F.V. and M.P. are supported by the NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

J,"Varley, TF",,,,"Varley, Thomas Z.",,,Decomposing past and future: Integrated information decomposition based on shared probability mass exclusions,PLOS ONE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CORTICAL NETWORKS,"A core feature of complex systems is that the interactions between elements in the present causally constrain their own futures, and the futures of other elements as the system evolves through time. To fully model all of these interactions (between elements, as well as ensembles of elements), it is possible to decompose the total information flowing from past to future into a set of non-overlapping temporal interactions that describe all the different modes by which information can be stored, transferred, or modified. To achieve this, I propose a novel information-theoretic measure of temporal dependency (I-tau sx) based on the logic of local probability mass exclusions. This integrated information decomposition can reveal emergent and higher-order interactions within the dynamics of a system, as well as refining existing measures. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, I apply the decomposition to spontaneous spiking activity recorded from dissociated neural cultures of rat cerebral cortex to show how different modes of information processing are distributed over the system. Furthermore, being a localizable analysis, I-tau sx can provide insight into the computational structure of single moments. I explore the time-resolved computational structure of neuronal avalanches and find that different types of information atoms have distinct profiles over the course of an avalanche, with the majority of non-trivial information dynamics happening before the first half of the cascade is completed. These analyses allow us to move beyond the historical focus on single measures of dependency such as information transfer or information integration, and explore a panoply of different relationships between elements (and groups of elements) in complex systems.","[Varley, Thomas Z.] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas Z.] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,,,NSF-NRT [1735095]; Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems at Indiana University Bloomington,NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems at Indiana University Bloomington,"T.F.Vis supportedby NSF-NRTgrant1735095,Interdisciplinary Trainingin ComplexNetworksand Systemsat IndianaUniversityBloomington.",,69,8,8,0,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 23,2023,18,3,,,,,,,e0282950,10.1371/journal.pone.0282950,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282950,,,31,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,F7KV1,36952508,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-23,WOS:000984103600091,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is well-known that heterogeneous connectivity strongly favors spread, but a precise characterization of the redundancy present in social networks and its effect on the robustness of transmission is still lacking. This gap is addressed by the metric backbone, a weight- and connectivity-preserving subgraph that is sufficient to compute all shortest paths of weighted graphs. This subgraph is obtained via algebraically-principled axioms and does not require statistical sampling based on null-models. We show that the metric backbones of nine contact networks obtained from proximity sensors in a variety of social contexts are generally very small, 49% of the original graph for one and ranging from about 6% to 20% for the others. This reflects a surprising amount of redundancy and reveals that shortest paths on these networks are very robust to random attacks and failures. We also show that the metric backbone preserves the full distribution of shortest paths of the original contact networks-which must include the shortest inter- and intra-community distances that define any community structure-and is a primary subgraph for epidemic transmission based on pure diffusion processes. This suggests that the organization of social contact networks is based on large amounts of shortest-path redundancy which shapes epidemic spread in human populations. Thus, the metric backbone is an important subgraph with regard to epidemic spread, the robustness of social networks, and any communication dynamics that depend on complex network shortest paths. Author summaryIt is through social networks that contagious diseases spread in human populations, as best illustrated by the current pandemic and efforts to contain it. Measuring such networks from human contact data typically results in noisy and dense graphs that need to be simplified for effective analysis, without removal of their essential features. Thus, the identification of a primary subgraph that maintains the social interaction structure and likely transmission pathways is of relevance for studying epidemic spreading phenomena as well as devising intervention strategies to hinder spread. Here we propose and study the metric backbone as an optimal subgraph for sparsification of social contact networks in the study of simple spreading dynamics. We demonstrate that it is a unique, algebraically-principled network subgraph that preserves all shortest paths. We also discover that nine contact networks obtained from proximity sensors in a variety of social contexts contain large amounts of redundant interactions that can be removed with very little impact on community structure and epidemic spread. This reveals that epidemic spread on social networks is very robust to random interaction removal. However, extraction of the metric backbone subgraph reveals which interventions-strategic removal of specific social interactions-are likely to result in maximum impediment to epidemic spread.","[Correia, Rion Brattig H.; Rocha, Luis H.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal; [Correia, Rion Brattig H.; Rocha, Luis H.] Binghamton Univ, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Barrat, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, Turing Ctr Living Syst, CNRS,CPT, Marseille, France; [Rocha, Luis H.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY","Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Binghamton Univ, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",rocha@binghamton.edu,"Correia, Rion/ADD-1721-2022","Brattig Correia, Rion/0000-0001-5460-9397; Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X","National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program [01LM011945-01]; Fulbright Commission fellowship; NSF-NRT [1735095]; CAPES Foundation fellowship [18668127]; Fundacao para a Cienciae a Tecnologia [PTDC-MEC-AND-30221-2017]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [DATAREDUX ANR-19-CE46-0008]","National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program; Fulbright Commission fellowship; NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); CAPES Foundation fellowship(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao para a Cienciae a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This work was partially funded by National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program, grant 01LM011945-01 (LMR and RBC), a Fulbright Commission fellowship (LMR), the NSF-NRT grant 1735095 Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems (LMR), a CAPES Foundation fellowship, grant 18668127 (RBC), the Fundacao para a Cienciae a Tecnologia, grant PTDC-MEC-AND-30221-2017 (RBC), and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) project DATAREDUX ANR-19-CE46-0008 (AB).

This includes everything from processing sensory information to perceive the environment, up to processing motor information to interact with the environment. Due to methodological limitations, it has been historically unclear how information processing changes during different cognitive or behavioral states and to what extent information is processed within or between the network of neurons in different brain areas. In this study, we leverage recent advances in the calculation of information dynamics to explore neural-level processing within and between the frontoparietal areas AIP, F5, and M1 during a delayed grasping task performed by three macaque monkeys. While information processing was high within all areas during all cognitive and behavioral states of the task, interareal processing varied widely: During visuomotor transformation, AIP and F5 formed a reciprocally connected processing unit, while no processing was present between areas during the memory period. Movement execution was processed globally across all areas with predominance of processing in the feedback direction. Furthermore, the fine-scale network structure reconfigured at the neuron level in response to different grasping conditions, despite no differences in the overall amount of information present. These results suggest that areas dynamically form higher-order processing units according to the cognitive or behavioral demand and that the information-processing network is hierarchically organized at the neuron level, with the coarse network structure determining the behavioral state and finer changes reflecting different conditions.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Schaffelhofer, Stefan; Scherberger, Hansjoerg; Dann, Benjamin] German Primate Ctr, Neurobiol Lab, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Schaffelhofer, Stefan; Scherberger, Hansjoerg] Univ Goettingen, Fac Biol & Psychol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Leibniz Association; Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ); University of Gottingen,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,,"Schaffelhofer, Stefan/0000-0002-1006-971X; Scherberger, Hansjorg/0000-0001-6593-2800",NSF-NRT [1735095]; NIH [R01 MH121978]; German Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01GQ1903],NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"T.F.V. is supported by NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

We suggest future design implications to mitigate these challenges and improve epilepsy information management and care coordination.","[Min, Aehong; Borner, Katy; Shih, Patrick C.] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Miller, Wendy R.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Rocha, Luis M.] Binghamton Univ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Rocha, Luis M.; Brattig Correia, Rion] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal","Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia","Min, A (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ahmin912@gmail.com; wrtruebl@iu.edu; rocha@binghamton.edu; katy@indiana.edu; rionbr@gmail.com; patshih@indiana.edu,"Correia, Rion/ADD-1721-2022; Shih, Patrick/AAG-9674-2019","Shih, Patrick/0000-0003-2460-0468; Miller, Wendy/0000-0003-1779-7290; Min, Aehong/0000-0002-3790-2126; Brattig Correia, Rion/0000-0001-5460-9397; Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X; Borner, Katy/0000-0002-3321-6137",National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health [R01LM012832]; Fulbright Commission Fellowship; National Science Foundation-Research Traineeship [1735095]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/MEC-AND/30221/2017],National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); Fulbright Commission Fellowship; National Science Foundation-Research Traineeship; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank our participants and reviewers for their constructive feedback on this research.

Employing stra-tegies such as planting early maturing or drought tolerant hybrid seeds is one common climate adaptive strategy for these households. However, seed choice has become increasingly complex for farmers. One way farmers look for clarity about seeds is to consult with other farmers. OBJECTIVE: We investigate smallholders' advice seeking within the context of a community water project in rural Kenya, a type of community-based common pool resource management organization. We examine a maize seed advice seeking network and compare it with a more general advice seeking network to better understand the social networks of maize seed advice seeking, and to characterize how peer-to-peer advice networks might factor into farmer decision-making about seeds. METHODS: We use exponential random graph modeling for the maize seed advice and general advice networks to test what factors predict advice-seeking among farmers in 104, or 92% of households in the community water project.","[Giroux, Stacey; Waldman, Kurt] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Giroux, Stacey] Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, 1020 Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, 700 N Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Waldman, Kurt; Blekking, Jordan] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Evans, Tom] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, 1064 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Caylor, Kelly K.] Univ Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Arizona,"Giroux, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.;Giroux, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",sagiroux@indiana.edu,"Blekking, Jordan/LCY-0679-2024; Caylor, Kelly/ABF-2818-2020","Kaminski, Patrick/0000-0002-2009-9170; Waldman, Kurt/0000-0002-9643-8378","United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative] [1830752]; NSF-NRT grant [1735095]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1830752] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative]; NSF-NRT grant; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Funding This research was supported by the United States National Science Foundation [WSC-Category 2 Collaborative #1830752; Patrick Kamin-ski is supported by NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems] .",,104,6,6,2,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

J,"Varley, TF; Kaminski, P",,,,"Varley, Thomas F.; Kaminski, Patrick",,,Untangling Synergistic Effects of Intersecting Social Identities with Partial Information Decomposition,ENTROPY,,,English,Article,,,,,,partial information decomposition; synergy; sociology; intersectionality; higher-order interactions,DEATHS,"The theory of intersectionality proposes that an individual's experience of society has aspects that are irreducible to the sum of one's various identities considered individually, but are greater than the sum of their parts. In recent years, this framework has become a frequent topic of discussion both in social sciences and among popular movements for social justice. In this work, we show that the effects of intersectional identities can be statistically observed in empirical data using information theory, particularly the partial information decomposition framework. We show that, when considering the predictive relationship between various identity categories such as race and sex, on outcomes such as income, health and wellness, robust statistical synergies appear. These synergies show that there are joint-effects of identities on outcomes that are irreducible to any identity considered individually and only appear when specific categories are considered together (for example, there is a large, synergistic effect of race and sex considered jointly on income irreducible to either race or sex). Furthermore, these synergies are robust over time, remaining largely constant year-to-year. We then show using synthetic data that the most widely used method of assessing intersectionalities in data (linear regression with multiplicative interaction coefficients) fails to disambiguate between truly synergistic, greater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts interactions, and redundant interactions. We explore the significance of these two distinct types of interactions in the context of making inferences about intersectional relationships in data and the importance of being able to reliably differentiate the two. Finally, we conclude that information theory, as a model-free framework sensitive to nonlinearities and synergies in data, is a natural method by which to explore the space of higher-order social dynamics.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kaminski, Patrick] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,,"Kaminski, Patrick/0000-0002-2009-9170; Varley, Thomas/0000-0002-3317-9882",NSF-NRT [1735095]; Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems at Indiana University Bloomington,NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems at Indiana University Bloomington,"T.F.V. and P.K. are supported by the NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems at Indiana University Bloomington.",,71,10,11,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,OCT,2022,24,10,,,,,,,1387,10.3390/e24101387,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e24101387,,,23,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,5O7EC,37420406,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-01-23,WOS:000872630700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hashtags in particular have acted as powerful social coordinators, playing a key role in organizing social movements like the Gezi park protests, Occupy Wall Street, #metoo, and #blacklivesmatter. Here we quantify collective identity from the use of hashtags as self-labels in over 85,000 actively-maintained Twitter user profiles spanning 2017-2019. Collective identities emerge from a graph model of individuals' overlapping self-labels, producing a hierarchy of graph clusters. Each cluster is bound together and characterized semantically by specific hashtags key to its formation. We define and apply two information-theoretic measures to quantify the strength of identities in the hierarchy. First we measure collective identity coherence to determine how integrated any identity is from local to global scales. Second, we consider the conspicuousness of any identity given its vocabulary versus the global identity map. Our work reveals a rich landscape of online identity emerging from the hierarchical alignment of uncoordinated self-labeling actions.","[Barron, Alexander T.

Using a suite of qualitative and quantitative methods, we juxtapose data from a farmer-oriented crisis hotline in Nebraska, the Nebraska Rural Response hotline, alongside semi-structured interviews with people working in organizations that respond to the current epidemic of farm stress. Taking these sources of data together, we find that farmers, ranchers, and members of farming commu-nities most frequently seek help for economic distress, and the most common psychiatric diagnosis assigned to hotline callers who seek therapeutic support is connected to both acute external events in rural life and high rates of suicide. We identify a crisis belt of high call volume in the Sandhills region of Nebraska and connect this geospatial finding to processes of economic restructuring in that region. Our findings support the claim that the current resources available to farmers in distress target individual farmers' responses to stress but do not address its causes, which can be understood in terms of economic restructuring and consequent adverse changes in the social fabric of rural communities. The mental health paradigm for farm-related distress constrains the possi-bilities for addressing it. We argue that analyzing this distress in terms of the production of rural sacrifice zones makes room for collective agency and systemic solutions to the root causes of farm-related distress.","[Heaberlin, Bradi] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Shattuck, Annie] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Heaberlin, B (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bmheaber@iu.edu,,"Shattuck, Annie/0000-0003-4127-8108",National Science Foundation [1735095],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),BH received funding for this research from the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Grant #1735095 Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.,,92,9,9,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

This framing raises the issue of how biological neural circuits actually process information, and some of the most fundamental outstanding questions in neuroscience center on understanding the mechanisms of neural information processing. Classical information theory has long been understood to be a natural framework within which information processing can be understood, and recent advances in the field of multivariate information theory offer new insights into the structure of computation in complex systems. In this review, we provide an introduction to the conceptual and practical issues associated with using multivariate information theory to analyze information processing in neural circuits, as well as discussing recent empirical work in this vein. Specifically, we provide an accessible introduction to the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. PID reveals redundant, unique, and synergistic modes by which neurons integrate information from multiple sources. We focus particularly on the synergistic mode, which quantifies the higher-order information carried in the patterns of multiple inputs and is not reducible to input from any single source. Recent work in a variety of model systems has revealed that synergistic dynamics are ubiquitous in neural circuitry and show reliable structure-function relationships, emerging disproportionately in neuronal rich clubs, downstream of recurrent connectivity, and in the convergence of correlated activity. We draw on the existing literature on higher-order information dynamics in neuronal networks to illustrate the insights that have been gained by taking an information decomposition perspective on neural activity. Finally, we briefly discuss future promising directions for information decomposition approaches to neuroscience, such as work on behaving animals, multi-target generalizations of PID, and time-resolved local analyses.","[Newman, Ehren L.; Varley, Thomas F.; Parakkattu, Vibin K.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Sherrill, Samantha P.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Beggs, John M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Phys, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Brighton; University of Sussex; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Newman, EL; Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ehnewman@iu.edu; tvarley@iu.edu; vparakka@iu.edu; spfaber91@gmail.com; jmbeggs@indiana.edu,,"Parakkattu, Vibin/0000-0002-7875-1803; Varley, Thomas/0000-0002-3317-9882; Newman, Ehren/0000-0001-7006-4112","Whitehall Foundation [17-12-114]; National Institutes of Health [R01AD076198]; National Science Foundation [1429500, 1513779, 1735095]; Indiana Space Grant Consortium; NSF-NRT grant Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems, at Indiana University, Bloomington [1735095]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [1429500] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1513779] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1735095] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Whitehall Foundation; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Indiana Space Grant Consortium; NSF-NRT grant Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems, at Indiana University, Bloomington; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","Ehren L.

They show that, depending on the topic, the information flows can spread as simple or complex contagion processes, operating at a critical regime. Statistical laws of information avalanches in social media appear, at least according to existing empirical studies, not robust across systems. As a consequence, radically different processes may represent plausible driving mechanisms for information propagation. Here, we analyze almost one billion time-stamped events collected from several online platforms - including Telegram, Twitter and Weibo - over observation windows longer than ten years, and show that the propagation of information in social media is a universal and critical process. Universality arises from the observation of identical macroscopic patterns across platforms, irrespective of the details of the specific system at hand. Critical behavior is deduced from the power-law distributions, and corresponding hyperscaling relations, characterizing size and duration of avalanches of information. Statistical testing on our data indicates that a mixture of simple and complex contagion characterizes the propagation of information in social media. Data suggest that the complexity of the process is correlated with the semantic content of the information that is propagated.","[Notarmuzi, Daniele; Flammini, Alessandro; Mazzilli, Dario; Radicchi, Filippo] Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Castellano, Claudio] Ist Sistemi Complessi ISC CNR, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Castellano, Claudio; Mazzilli, Dario] Ctr Ric Enrico Fermi, Via Panisperna 89 A, Rome, Italy",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto dei Sistemi Complessi (ISC-CNR),"Radicchi, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",filiradi@indiana.edu,"Castellano, Claudio/B-6946-2008; Notarmuzi, Daniele/HFZ-8250-2022; Mazzilli, Dario/AFU-0078-2022; Radicchi, Filippo/B-4407-2009","Radicchi, Filippo/0000-0002-8352-1287; Castellano, Claudio/0000-0002-3773-3801; Notarmuzi, Daniele/0000-0001-5565-3971; Mazzilli, Dario/0000-0001-7948-7584",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1552487]; National Science Foundation NRT [1735095]; DARPA award [HR001121C0169],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation NRT; DARPA award(United States Department of Defense),"F.R. acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation (CMMI-1552487).

Regions of the basal ganglia are extensively interconnected with the cortex via reciprocal connections that relay and modulate cortical function. Here we employ an edge-centric approach, which computes co-fluctuations among region pairs in a network to investigate the role and interaction of subcortical regions with cortical systems. By clustering edges into communities, we show that cortical systems and subcortical regions couple via multiple edge communities, with hippocampus and amygdala having a distinct pattern from striatum and thalamus. We show that the edge community structure of cortical networks is highly similar to one obtained from cortical nodes when the subcortex is present in the network. Additionally, we show that the edge community profile of both cortical and subcortical nodes can be estimates solely from cortico-subcortical interactions. Finally, we used a motif analysis focusing on edge community triads where a subcortical region coupled to two cortical regions and found that two community triads where one community couples the subcortex to the cortex were overrepresented. In summary, our results show organized coupling of the subcortex to the cortex that may play a role in cortical organization of primary sensorimotor/attention and heteromodal systems and puts forth the motif analysis of edge community triads as a promising method for investigation of communication patterns in networks.","[Chumin, Evgeny J.; Faskowitz, Joshua; Esfahlani, Farnaz Zamani; Jo, Youngheun; Cutts, Sarah A.; Betzel, Richard; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Jo, Youngheun; Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob; Betzel, Richard; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN USA; [Faskowitz, Joshua] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN USA; [Chumin, Evgeny J.] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Merritt, Haily; Tanner, Jacob; Pope, Maria] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Chumin, EJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Chumin, EJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",echumin@iu.edu,"Jo, Youngheun/JUV-2426-2023; Faskowitz, Josh/K-1330-2019; Betzel, Richard/AFL-9399-2022",,NSF [2023985]; National Institute on Aging Training Grant on Alzheimer's Disease and ADRD [AG071444]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1342962]; NRT grant [1735095]; Indiana University Network Science Institute; Lilly Endowment through the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute; Indiana METACyt Initiative; Lilly Endowment; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1U54MH091657]; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [2023985] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute on Aging Training Grant on Alzheimer's Disease and ADRD; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NRT grant; Indiana University Network Science Institute; Lilly Endowment through the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute; Indiana METACyt Initiative; Lilly Endowment; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)),"This research was supported in-part by NSF grant no. 2023985 (R.B. and O.S.), the National Institute on Aging Training Grant on Alzheimer's Disease and ADRD (AG071444; E.J.C), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under grant no. 1342962 (J.F.) and NRT grant no. 1735095 Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems  (J.T., H.M., and M.P.), and the Indiana University Network Science Institute (E.J.C.)

We discuss how varying degrees and kinds of flexibility may be adaptive (or maladaptive) in different contexts, specifically focusing on measures related to either more disjoint or cohesive dynamics. While disjointed flexibility may be useful for assessing neural entropy, cohesive flexibility may potentially serve as a proxy for self-organized criticality as a fundamental property enabling adaptive behavior in complex systems. Particular attention is given to recent studies in which flexibility methods have been used to investigate neurological and cognitive maturation, as well as the breakdown of conscious processing under varying levels of anesthesia. We further discuss how these findings and methods might be contextualized within the Free Energy Principle with respect to the fundamentals of brain organization and biological functioning more generally, and describe potential methodological advances from this paradigm. Finally, with relevance to computational psychiatry, we propose a research program for obtaining a better understanding of ways that dynamic networks may relate to different forms of psychological flexibility, which may be the single most important factor for ensuring human flourishing.","[Safron, Adam] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, Baltimore, MD USA; [Safron, Adam] Indiana Univ, Kinsey Inst, Bloomington, IN USA; [Safron, Adam; Klimaj, Victoria] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN USA; [Klimaj, Victoria] Indiana Univ, Complex Networks & Syst, Informat Dept, Bloomington, IN USA; [Hipolito, Ines] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Dept Philosophy, Berlin, Germany; [Hipolito, Ines] UCL, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London, England",Johns Hopkins University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of London; University College London,"Hipolito, I (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Dept Philosophy, Berlin, Germany.;Hipolito, I (corresponding author), UCL, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London, England.",ines.hipolito@hu-berlin.de,"Safron, Adam/AAB-1428-2021","Safron, Adam/0000-0002-3102-7623; Hipolito, Ines/0000-0001-6351-9975",German Research Foundation (DFG); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; National Science Foundation NRT grant [1735095]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1735095] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; National Science Foundation NRT grant; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"We acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Open Access Publication Fund of HumboldtUniversitat zu Berlin.

Given their high connectivity, biochemical dynamics are surprisingly not chaotic but quite robust to perturbations-a feature C.H. Waddington named canalization. Because organisms are also flexible enough to evolve, they arguably operate in a critical dynamical regime between order and chaos. The established theory of criticality is based on networks of interacting automata where Boolean truth values model presence/absence of biochemical molecules. The dynamical regime is predicted using network connectivity and node bias (to be on/off) as tuning parameters. Revising this to account for canalization leads to a significant improvement in dynamical regime prediction. The revision is based on effective connectivity, a measure of dynamical redundancy that buffers automata response to some inputs. In both random and experimentally validated systems biology networks, reducing effective connectivity makes living systems operate in stable or critical regimes even though the structure of their biochemical interaction networks predicts them to be chaotic. This suggests that dynamical redundancy may be naturally selected to maintain living systems near critical dynamics, providing both robustness and evolvability. By identifying how dynamics propagates preferably via effective pathways, our approach helps to identify precise ways to design and control network models of biochemical regulation and signalling.","[Manicka, Santosh; Marques-Pita, Manuel; Rocha, Luis M.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Manicka, Santosh; Marques-Pita, Manuel; Rocha, Luis M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Marques-Pita, Manuel] Univ Lusofona, CICANT, Campo Grande 388, P-1700097 Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques-Pita, Manuel] Univ Lusofona, COPELABS, Campo Grande 388, P-1700097 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rocha, Luis M.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; Lusofona University; Lusofona University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY","Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",rocha@binghamton.edu,"Pita, Manuel/AAI-2583-2021","Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X; Marques Pita, Manuel/0000-0003-2180-6823; Manicka, Santosh/0000-0002-8747-2363","National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program [01LM011945-01]; Fulbright Commission fellowship; NSFNRT [1735095]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal) [PTDC/EIA-CCO/114108/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EIA-CCO/114108/2009] Funding Source: FCT","National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program; Fulbright Commission fellowship; NSFNRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","L.M.R. was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine Program, grant no. 01LM011945-01, by a Fulbright Commission fellowship, by NSFNRT grant no. 1735095 `Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems,' and by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal) grant no.

First, we show that our model overcomes the correlationproblem between routes, a common pitfall of traditional logit models, and that the choiceaversion model can be seen as an alternative to these models. Second, we show how our modelcan generate violations of regularity in the path choice probabilities. In particular, we showthat removing edges in the network may decrease the probability for existing paths. Finally,we show that under the presence of choice aversion, adding edges to the network can makeusers worse off. In other words, a type of Braess's paradox can emerge outside of congestion andcan be characterized in terms of a parameter that measures users' degree of choice aversion.We validate these contributions by estimating this parameter over GPS traffic data captured ona real-world transportation network.","[Knies, Austin; Melo, Emerson] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 307 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Lorca, Jorge] Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Central Bank of Chile,"Melo, E (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 307 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",ausknies@iu.edu; jlorca@bcentral.cl; emelo@iu.edu,,"Lorca, Jorge/0000-0003-0427-1396; Knies, Austin/0000-0002-1109-5864; Melo, Emerson/0000-0002-5422-7644",National Science Foundation NRT grant [1735095]; Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1735095] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation NRT grant; Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

However, the majority of studies have overlooked the complexity of disorders in favor of a present/not present dichotomy in representing disorders. Recent psychological research challenges favors transdiagnostic approaches, moving beyond general disorder classifications to symptom level analysis, as symptoms are often not exclusive to individual disorder classes. In our study, we investigated the link between speech signals and psychological distress symptoms in a corpus of 333 screening interviews from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC). Given the semi-structured organization of interviews, we aggregated speech utterances from responses to shared questions across interviews. We employed deterministic sample selection in classification to rank salient questions for eliciting symptomspecific behaviors in order to predict symptom presence. Some questions include Do you find therapy helpful? and When was the last time you felt happy?. The prediction results align closely to the factor structure of psychological distress symptoms, linking speech behaviors primarily to somatic and affective alterations in both depression and PTSD. This lends support for the transdiagnostic validity of speech markers for detecting such symptoms. Surprisingly, we did not find a strong link between speech markers and cognitive or psychomotor alterations. This is surprising, given the complexity of motor and cognitive actions required in speech production. The results of our analysis highlight the importance of aligning affective computing research with psychological research to investigate the use of automatic behavioral sensing to assess psychiatric risk.","[Zhang, Larry] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kolacz, Jacek] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rizzo, Albert; Scherer, Stefan; Soleymani, Mohammad] Univ Southern Calif, Inst Creat Technol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Southern California,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",larzhang@iu.edu; jacek.kolacz@osumc.edu; rizzo@ict.usc.edu; scherer@ict.usc.edu; soleymani@ict.usc.edu,"Soleymani, Mohammad/AAS-2161-2020",,Army Research Office [W911NF-20-2-0053]; NIAAA [R01 AA027225]; NSF [1735095],Army Research Office; NIAAA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Research was sponsored in-part by the Army Research Office and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-20-2-0053.

Empirical studies have shown that functional connectivity fluctuates over time, exhibiting patterns that vary in the spatial arrangement of correlations among segregated functional systems. Recently, an exact decomposition of functional connectivity into frame-wise contributions has revealed fine-scale dynamics that are punctuated by brief and intermittent episodes (events) of high-amplitude cofluctuations involving large sets of brain regions. Their origin is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that similar episodes readily appear in silico using computational simulations of wholebrain dynamics. As in empirical data, simulated events contribute disproportionately to long-time functional connectivity, involve recurrence of patterned cofluctuations, and can be clustered into distinct families. Importantly, comparison of event-related patterns of cofluctuations to underlying patterns of structural connectivity reveals that modular organization present in the coupling matrix shapes patterns of event-related cofluctuations. Our work suggests that brief, intermittent events in functional dynamics are partly shaped by modular organization of structural connectivity.","[Pope, Maria; Betzel, Richard F.; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pope, Maria] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fukushima, Makoto] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Div Informat Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Fukushima, Makoto] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Betzel, Richard F.; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Betzel, Richard F.; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Betzel, Richard F.; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Nara Institute of Science & Technology; National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Sporns, O (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Sporns, O (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Sporns, O (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Sporns, O (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",osporns@indiana.edu,"Betzel, Richard/AFL-9399-2022; Fukushima, Makoto/E-6006-2015","Pope, Maria/0000-0001-6717-7132; Fukushima, Makoto/0000-0003-2345-2598","NSF [IIS-2023985, 1735095]; Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks; Indiana University Office of the Vice President for Research Emerging Area of Research Initiative, Learning: Brains, Machines and Children; Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Con sortium [1U54MH091657]; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H05066, 21K15610] Funding Source: KAKEN","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks; Indiana University Office of the Vice President for Research Emerging Area of Research Initiative, Learning: Brains, Machines and Children; Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Con sortium; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This material is based on work supported by NSF Grant IIS-2023985 (R.F.B., O.

We investigate the complexity of such interactions by inferring a connection transitivity that includes all possible measures of path length for weighted graphs. The result, without breaking the graph into smaller components, is a distance backbone subgraph sufficient to compute all shortest paths. This is important for understanding the dynamics of spread and communication phenomena in real-world networks. The general methodology we formally derive yields a principled graph reduction technique and provides a finer characterization of the triangular geometry of all edges-those that contribute to shortest paths and those that do not but are involved in other network phenomena. We demonstrate that the distance backbone is very small in large networks across domains ranging from air traffic to the human brain connectome, revealing that network robustness to attacks and failures seems to stem from surprisingly vast amounts of redundancy.","[Simas, Tiago] Univ Lusofona, Dept Engn Informat & Sistemas Informacao, Lisbon, Portugal; [Correia, Rion Brattig; Rocha, Luis M.] Indiana Univ, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Correia, Rion Brattig; Rocha, Luis M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal; [Correia, Rion Brattig] Minist Educ Brazil, CAPES Fdn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Rocha, Luis M.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Lusofona University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY","Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",rocha@binghamton.edu,"Correia, Rion/ADD-1721-2022","Simas, Tiago/0000-0002-3133-1537; Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X",,,,,82,12,14,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1310,2051-1329,,J COMPLEX NETW,J.

We developed a computational model to investigate the motility and phenotypic persistence of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells during tumor progression. The cellular behavior was defined by phenotypic persistence time, cell movement bias, and the fraction of cells that respond to an enhanced migratory stimulus.

In recent years farmers have faced multiple socioeconomic threats such as a trade war with China, industry consolidation, and decreasing farmgate prices, as well as multiple environmental threats, including flooding and drought. We analyze farmers' assessments of these concurrent risks and their relationship to stress and farm exit, through a mail survey of 210 soy and dairy farmers in Indiana. On average, environmental threats are perceived as less of a threat to farmers than to immediate socioeconomic threats such as the trade war and, more importantly, long-run economic issues such as price decline and consolidation. We find evidence that farm exit is largely determined by farmer identity, perspectives on the trade war, and stress. The ongoing trade war with China is a key source of stress for soybean farmers and federal payments from the Market Facilitation Program are unlikely to stem farm exit. Addressing the farm exit problem and mitigating the current farm crisis necessitates greater attention to how policies, indirectly lead to farm exit through stress.","[Waldman, Kurt B.; Giroux, Stacey A.; Farmer, James R.; Heaberlin, Bradi M.; Blekking, Jordan P.; Todd, Peter M.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Waldman, KB (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kbwaldma@iu.edu,"Blekking, Jordan/LCY-0679-2024","Waldman, Kurt/0000-0002-9643-8378",Provost's Office; Office of the Vice Provost for Research at Indiana University,Provost's Office; Office of the Vice Provost for Research at Indiana University,"This research was funded by the Provost's Office and the Office of the Vice Provost for Research at Indiana University.

Despite both being anaesthetics, propofol and ketamine produce different subjective states: we explore the different effects of these two anaesthetics on the structure of dynamic attractors reconstructed from electrophysiological activity recorded from cerebral cortex of two macaques. We used two methods: the first embeds the recordings in a continuous high-dimensional manifold on which we use topological data analysis to infer the presence of higher-order dynamics. The second reconstruction, an ordinal partition network embedding, allows us to create a discrete state-transition network, which is amenable to information-theoretic analysis and contains rich information about state-transition dynamics. We find that the awake condition generally had the 'richest' structure, visiting the most states, the presence of pronounced higher-order structures, and the least deterministic dynamics. By contrast, the propofol condition had the most dissimilar dynamics, transitioning to a more impoverished, constrained, low-structure regime. The ketamine condition, interestingly, seemed to combine aspects of both: while it was generally less complex than the awake condition, it remained well above propofol in almost all measures. These results provide deeper and more comprehensive insights than what is typically gained by using point-measures of complexity.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Denny, Vanessa; Sporns, Olaf] Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat, Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Sporns, Olaf; Patania, Alice] Indiana Univ Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat, Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,"Patania, Alice/K-1612-2019","Patania, Alice/0000-0002-3047-4376","NSF-NRT, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems [1735095]; Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI); NIH/NIMH [1RO1MH121978-01]","NSF-NRT, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems; Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI); NIH/NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","T.F.V. is supported by NSF-NRT grant no. 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

However, no one has demonstrated a causal effect of cell phone access on health and well-being. Using a 7-month longitudinal field experiment we investigated how stable cellphone access impacts health and quality of life of people experiencing poverty (N = 45, median annual income = $7,216). Participants received phone cards providing unlimited talk, text, and data (n = 23) or were given grocery store gift cards of the equivalent amount (n = 22). Over the course of the experiment, participants in the treatment group reported better health and quality of life compared to those in the control group. Emotional social support moderated this relationship in such a way that those with the least social support benefited the most from stable cellphone access (supporting a 'poor-get-richer' hypothesis).

Evidence suggests men's pornography use is positively associated with both forms, but mechanistic dehumanization of women is more associated with aggressive attitudes while animalistic dehumanization is more associated with aggressive behaviors.

These network models provide deep insights into the organization, dynamics, and function of biochemical systems: for example, by revealing genetic control pathways involved in disease. However, the traditional representation of biochemical networks as binary interaction graphs fails to accurately represent an important dynamical feature of these multivariate systems: some pathways propagate control signals much more effectively than do others. Such heterogeneity of interactions reflects canalization-the system is robust to dynamical interventions in redundant pathways but responsive to interventions in effective pathways. Here, we introduce the effective graph, a weighted graph that captures the nonlinear logical redundancy present in biochemical network regulation, signaling, and control. Using 78 experimentally validated models derived from systems biology, we demonstrate that 1) redundant pathways are prevalent in biological models of biochemical regulation, 2) the effective graph provides a probabilistic but precise characterization of multivariate dynamics in a causal graph form, and 3) the effective graph provides an accurate explanation of how dynamical perturbation and control signals, such as those induced by cancer drug therapies, propagate in biochemical pathways. Overall, our results indicate that the effective graph provides an enriched description of the structure and dynamics of networked multivariate causal interactions. We demonstrate that it improves explainability, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems in general and biochemical regulation in particular.","[Gates, Alexander J.] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Correia, Rion Brattig; Rocha, Luis M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Correia, Rion Brattig] Minist Educ Brazil, Coordenacao Aperfeicoamento Pessoal Nivel Super, BR-70040020 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Wang, Xuan; Rocha, Luis M.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Rocha, Luis M.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Northeastern University; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY","Gates, AJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Social & Biomed Complex, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.;Rocha, LM (corresponding author), Binghamton Univ, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",a.gates@northeastern.edu; rocha@binghamton.edu,"Correia, Rion/ADD-1721-2022; Gates, Alexander/O-9825-2017","Brattig Correia, Rion/0000-0001-5460-9397; Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X; Gates, Alexander/0000-0003-0099-7480; Wang, Xuan/0000-0001-6925-6264","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [18668127]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PTDC/MEC-AND/30221/2017]; NIH, National Library of Medicine Grant [1R01LM012832]; Fulbright Commission fellowship; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems [1735095]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/MEC-AND/30221/2017] Funding Source: FCT","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); NIH, National Library of Medicine Grant; Fulbright Commission fellowship; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We thank Santosh Manicka and Manuel MarquesPita for helpful discussions, Deborah Rocha for editing the manuscript, and Alice Grishchenko for graphics consultation.

In an experimental study, participants watched eight police use of force videos-half recorded from BWC and half from an onlooker's perspective-in which skin tone of the citizen varied. Results indicate that POV interacts with citizen skin tone such that, compared to the onlooker perspective, the BWC exacerbated viewer racial bias against dark skin tone citizens.

Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos. A minority of accounts and pages exert a strong influence on each platform. These misinformation superspreaders are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms.

Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as dissociative anaesthesia). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness. Author summary Here we explore how different anaesthetic drugs change the nature of brain dynamics, using neural activity recorded from sub-dural electrophysiological arrays implanted in a macaque brain. Previous research has suggested that loss of consciousness under anaesthesia is associated with a movement away from critical brain dynamics, towards a less flexible regime. When comparing ketamine and propofol, two anaesthetics with largely different effects on consciousness, we find that propofol, but not ketamine, produces a dramatic reduction in the complexity of brain activity and restricts the range of scales where critical dynamics are plausible. These results suggest that maintenance of critical dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Sporns, Olaf; Puce, Aina] Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Beggs, John] Indiana Univ, Dept Phys, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,"; Sporns, Olaf/A-1667-2010","Puce, Aina/0000-0002-0716-4185; Sporns, Olaf/0000-0001-7265-4036",NSF-NRT grant [1735095],NSF-NRT grant,"TFV is supported by the NSF-NRT grant 1735095, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems.

While the concept of criticality is of central importance to this theory, few of the published studies on psychedelics investigate it directly, testing instead related measures such as algorithmic complexity or Shannon entropy. We propose using the fractal dimension of functional activity in the brain as a measure of complexity since findings from physics suggest that as a system organizes towards criticality, it tends to take on a fractal structure. We tested two different measures of fractal dimension, one spatial and one temporal, using fMRI data from volunteers under the influence of both LSD and psilocybin. The first was the fractal dimension of cortical functional connectivity networks and the second was the fractal dimension of BOLD time-series. In addition to the fractal measures, we used a well-established, non-fractal measure of signal complexity and show that they behave similarly. We were able to show that both psychedelic drugs significantly increased the fractal dimension of functional connectivity networks, and that LSD significantly increased the fractal dimension of BOLD signals, with psilocybin showing a non-significant trend in the same direction. With both LSD and psilocybin, we were able to localize changes in the fractal dimension of BOLD signals to brain areas assigned to the dorsal-attenion network. These results show that psychedelic drugs increase the fractal dimension of activity in the brain and we see this as an indicator that the changes in consciousness triggered by psychedelics are associated with evolution towards a critical zone.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Menon, David K.; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, England; [Varley, Thomas F.; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge, England; [Carhart-Harris, Robin; Roseman, Leor] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, Dept Med, London, England; [Roseman, Leor] Imperial Coll London, Computat Cognit & Clin Neurosci Lab, Dept Med, London, England; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, England.",tvarley@iu.edu,"Roseman, Leor/AEG-5116-2022; Menon, David/AEX-7615-2022","Stamatakis, Emmanuel Andreas/0000-0001-6955-9601; Roseman, Leor/0000-0001-9990-6029","NSF-NRT, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems [1735095]; MRC; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR, UK); Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Senior Investigator Awards; Stephen Erskine Fellowship Queens' College Cambridge; Beckley Foundation; Alex Mosley Charitable Trust; Ad Astria Chandaria Foundation; Imperial President's Scholarship; Walacea.com crowdfunding campaign; Neuro-psychoanalysis Foundation; Multidisplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies; Heffter Research Institute","NSF-NRT, Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR, UK)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Senior Investigator Awards; Stephen Erskine Fellowship Queens' College Cambridge; Beckley Foundation; Alex Mosley Charitable Trust; Ad Astria Chandaria Foundation; Imperial President's Scholarship; Walacea.com crowdfunding campaign; Neuro-psychoanalysis Foundation; Multidisplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies; Heffter Research Institute","The data presented in this study was collected at the National Institute of Health Research/Wellcome Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility.

One of the prevailing theories of adaptive behavior is that organisms are constantly making predictions about their future environmental stimuli. However, how they acquire that predictive information is still poorly understood. Two complementary mechanisms have been proposed: predictions are generated from an agent's internal model of the world or predictions are extracted directly from the environmental stimulus. In this work, we demonstrate that predictive information, measured using bivariate mutual information, cannot distinguish between these two kinds of systems. Furthermore, we show that predictive information cannot distinguish between organisms that are adapted to their environments and random dynamical systems exposed to the same environment. To understand the role of predictive information in adaptive behavior, we need to be able to identify where it is generated. To do this, we decompose information transfer across the different components of the organism-environment system and track the flow of information in the system over time. To validate the proposed framework, we examined it on a set of computational models of idealized agent-environment systems. Analysis of the systems revealed three key insights. First, predictive information, when sourced from the environment, can be reflected in any agent irrespective of its ability to perform a task. Second, predictive information, when sourced from the nervous system, requires special dynamics acquired during the process of adapting to the environment. Third, the magnitude of predictive information in a system can be different for the same task if the environmental structure changes.","[Candadai, Madhavun; Izquierdo, Eduardo J.] Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Candadai, Madhavun; Izquierdo, Eduardo J.] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Izquierdo, EJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Cognit Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Izquierdo, EJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",edizquie@iu.edu,,,"NSF [NSF-1845322]; NSF-NRT [1735095]; Lilly Endowment, Inc.","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-NRT(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Lilly Endowment, Inc.","The authors would like to thank John M.

In addition, they represent an untapped resource for studying the effects of gender on the doctor-patient relationship. Understanding gender differences in online reviews is important because it may impact the value of those reviews to patients. Documenting gender differences in patient experience may also help to improve the doctor-patient relationship. This is the first large-scale study of physician reviews to extensively investigate gender bias in online reviews or offer recommendations for improvements to online review systems to correct for gender bias and aid patients in selecting a physician. Objective: This study examines 154,305 reviews from across the United States for all medical specialties. Our analysis includes a qualitative and quantitative examination of review content and physician rating with regard to doctor and reviewer gender. Methods: A total of 154,305 reviews were sampled from Google Place reviews. Reviewer and doctor gender were inferred from names. Reviews were coded for overall patient experience (negative or positive) by collapsing a 5-star scale and coded for general categories (process, positive/negative soft skills), which were further subdivided into themes. Computational text processing methods were employed to apply this codebook to the entire data set, rendering it tractable to quantitative methods. Specifically, we estimated binary regression models to examine relationships between physician rating, patient experience themes, physician gender, and reviewer gender). Results: Female reviewers wrote 60% more reviews than men. Male reviewers were more likely to give negative reviews (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.19; P<.001). Reviews of female physicians were considerably more negative than those of male physicians (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.94-2.14; P<.001). Soft skills were more likely to be mentioned in the reviews written by female reviewers and about female physicians. Negative reviews of female doctors were more likely to mention candor (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.82; P<.001) and amicability (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.47-1.90; P<.001). Disrespect was associated with both female physicians (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35-1.51; P<.001) and female reviewers (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19-1.35; P<.001). Female patients were less likely to report disrespect from female doctors than expected from the base ORs (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.32; P=.008), but this effect overrode only the effect for female reviewers. Conclusions: This work reinforces findings in the extensive literature on gender differences and gender bias in patient-physician interaction. Its novel contribution lies in highlighting gender differences in online reviews. These reviews inform patients' choice of doctor and thus affect both patients and physicians. The evidence of gender bias documented here suggests review sites may be improved by providing information about gender differences, controlling for gender when presenting composite ratings for physicians, and helping users write less biased reviews.","[Dunivin, Zackary; Siek, Katie] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Zadunayski, Lindsay] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY USA; [Baskota, Ujjwal] Jackson State Univ, Jackson, MS USA; [Mankoff, Jennifer] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Jackson State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Mankoff, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Bill & Melinda Gates Ctr Comp Sci & Engn, 3800 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jmankoffg@acm.org,"Dunivin, Zackary/HII-6014-2022","Siek, Katie/0000-0001-8632-2411; Zadunayski, Lindsay/0000-0002-6989-356X; Dunivin, Zackary/0000-0002-1860-7199; Mankoff, Jennifer/0000-0001-9235-5324",,,,,46,12,13,1,34,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

However, whether correlation is favorable or not is contentious. Here, we sought to determine how correlated activity and information processing are related in cortical circuits. Using recordings of hundreds of spiking neurons in organotypic cultures of mouse neocortex, we asked whether mutual information between neurons that feed into a common third neuron increased synergistic information processing by the receiving neuron. We found that mutual information and synergistic processing were positively related at synaptic timescales (0.05-14 ms), where mutual information values were low. This effect was mediated by the increase in information transmission of which synergistic processing is a component that resulted as mutual information grew. However, at extrasynaptic windows (up to 3,000 ms), where mutual information values were high, the relationship between mutual information and synergistic processing became negative. In this regime, greater mutual information resulted in a disproportionate increase in redundancy relative to information transmission. These results indicate that the emergence of synergistic processing from correlated activity differs according to timescale and correlation regime. In a low-correlation regime, synergistic processing increases with greater correlation, and in a high-correlation regime, synergistic processing decreases with greater correlation.","[Sherrill, Samantha P.; Newman, Ehren L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Sherrill, Samantha P.; Beggs, John M.; Newman, Ehren L.] Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Timme, Nicholas M.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol, Indianapolis, IN 46205 USA; [Beggs, John M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Phys, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Sherrill, SP (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Sherrill, SP (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Program Neurosci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",samfaber@indiana.edu,,,"Whitehall Foundation [17-12-114]; National Science Foundation [1429500, 1513779, 1735095]; Indiana Space Grant Consortium; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1735095] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1429500] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1513779] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Whitehall Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Indiana Space Grant Consortium; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)),"Ehren Newman, Whitehall Foundation (http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391), Award ID: 17-12-114.

We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.","[Salganik, Matthew J.; Lundberg, Ian; Kindel, Alexander T.; Stewart, Brandon M.; McLanahan, Sara] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ahearn, Caitlin E.; Brand, Jennie E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Al-Ghoneim, Khaled] Hawaz, Riyadh 12363, Saudi Arabia; [Almaatouq, Abdullah] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Almaatouq, Abdullah; Pentland, Alex; Suhara, Yoshihiko] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Altschul, Drew M.] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Psychol, Mental Hlth Data Sci Scotland, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Brand, Jennie E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Carnegie, Nicole Bohme] Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Human Comp Interact Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Datta, Debanjan] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Discovery Analyt Ctr, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Davidson, Thomas] Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Compton, Ryan James; Filippova, Anna] GitHub, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; [Gilroy, Connor] Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Goode, Brian J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Fralin Life Sci Inst, Social & Decis Analyt Lab, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Jahani, Eaman] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kashyap, Ridhi] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Oxford OX1 1JD, England; [Kashyap, Ridhi] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Kashyap, Ridhi] Univ Oxford, Sch Anthropol, Oxford OX2 6PE, England; [Kashyap, Ridhi] Univ Oxford, Museum Ethnog, Oxford OX2 6PE, England; [Kirchner, Antje] RTI Int, Survey Res Div, Program Res Survey Methodol, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [McKay, Stephen] Univ Lincoln, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England; [Morgan, Allison C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Polimis, Kivan; Leizman, Ben] Univ Washington, Ctr Study Demog & Ecol, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Raes, Louis] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Rigobon, Daniel E.; Jain, Naman] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Roberts, Claudia V.; Amos, Ryan B.; Moeser, Malte; Mahajan, Mayank; Musse, Ahmed; Or, Andrew; Ouyang, Karen; Qian, Crystal; Schaffner, Thomas; Tang, Jonathan D.; Wang, Julia; Weissman, Samantha; Wu, Catherine; Narayanan, Arvind] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Stanescu, Diana M.; Wang, Erik H.; Liu, Naijia; Mack, Andrew E.; Schonfeld, Bryan; Knox, Dean] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Usmania, Adaner] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Adem, Muna; Halpern-Manners, Andrew; Kaminski, Patrick; Marahrens, Helge] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Alhajri, Abdulla] MIT, Dept Nucl Sci & Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [AlShebli, Bedoor] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Social Sci Div, Computat Social Sci Lab, Abu Dhabi 129188, U Arab Emirates; [Amin, Redwane; Niu, Qiankun] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Argyle, Lisa P.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Baer-Bositis, Livia; Freese, Jeremy; Gagne, Josh; Hausen, Sonia; Higuera, Kimberly; Hummel, Lisa M.; Kim, E.

We propose fractal shapes as a measure of proximity to this critical point, as fractal dimension encodes information about complexity beyond simple entropy or randomness, and fractal structures are known to emerge in systems nearing a critical point. To validate this, we tested several measures of fractal dimension on the brain activity from healthy volunteers and patients with disorders of consciousness of varying severity. We used a Compact Box Burning algorithm to compute the fractal dimension of cortical functional connectivity networks as well as computing the fractal dimension of the associated adjacency matrices using a 2D box-counting algorithm. To test whether brain activity is fractal in time as well as space, we used the Higuchi temporal fractal dimension on BOLD time-series. We found significant decreases in the fractal dimension between healthy volunteers (n = 15), patients in a minimally conscious state (n = 10), and patients in a vegetative state (n = 8), regardless of the mechanism of injury. We also found significant decreases in adjacency matrix fractal dimension and Higuchi temporal fractal dimension, which correlated with decreasing level of consciousness. These results suggest that cortical functional connectivity networks display fractal character and that this is associated with level of consciousness in a clinically relevant population, with higher fractal dimensions (i.e. more complex) networks being associated with higher levels of consciousness. This supports the hypothesis that level of consciousness and system complexity are positively associated, and is consistent with previous EEG, MEG, and fMRI studies.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Craig, Michael; Adapa, Ram; Finoia, Paola; Menon, David K.; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, Cambs, England; [Williams, Guy; Pickard, John; Menon, David K.] Univ Cambridge, Wolfson Brain Imaging Ctr, Cambridge, Cambs, England; [Allanson, Judith] Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Neurorehabil, Cambridge, Cambs, England; [Pickard, John] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Neurosurg, Cambridge, Cambs, England; [Varley, Thomas F.; Craig, Michael; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge, Cambs, England; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, Cambs, England.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge, Cambs, England.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,"Menon, David/AEX-7615-2022; Adapa, Ram/D-7925-2012","Williams, Guy/0000-0001-5223-6654; Menon, David/0000-0002-3228-9692; Stamatakis, Emmanuel Andreas/0000-0001-6955-9601; Adapa, Ram/0000-0002-9845-8532","Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellowship [083660/Z/07/Z]; UK Medical Research Council [U.1055.01.002.00001.01]; James S.

Consequently, we developed information retrieval (IR) models to retrieve DDI and drug-gene interaction (DGI) evidence from 25 million PubMed abstracts and distinguish DDI evidence into in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK), clinical PK, and clinical pharmacodynamic (PD) studies for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and withdrawn drugs. Additionally, information extraction models were developed to extract DDI-pairs and DGI-pairs from the IR-retrieved abstracts. An overlapping analysis identified 986 unique DDI-pairs between all 3 types of evidence. Another 2,157 and 13,012 DDI-pairs and 3,173 DGI-pairs were identified from known clinical PK/PD DDI, clinical PD DDI, and DGI evidence, respectively. By integrating DDI and DGI evidence, we discovered 119 and 18 new pharmacogenetic hypotheses associated with CYP3A and CYP2D6, respectively. Some of these DGI evidence can also aid us in understanding DDI mechanisms.","[Wu, Heng-Yi] Genentech Inc, 460 Point San Bruno Blvd, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Shendre, Aditi; Zhang, Shijun; Zhang, Pengyue; Wang, Lei; Ning, Xia; Li, Lang] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zeruesenay, Desta; Quinney, Sara K.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Rocha, Luis M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN USA; [Rocha, Luis M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal; [Shatkay, Hagit] Univ Delaware, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Quinney, Sara K.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Ning, Xia] Ohio State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Roche Holding; Roche Holding USA; Genentech; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; University of Delaware; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Shendre, A; Ning, X; Li, L (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Ning, X (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",aditi.shendre@osumc.edu; xia.ning@osumc.edu; lang.li@osumc.edu,"Zhang, Shijun/AAI-2890-2021; Quinney, Sara/J-5130-2014","Shendre, Aditi/0000-0003-4123-7613; Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X; Quinney, Sara/0000-0002-6554-0695",National Library of Medicine [R01LM011945]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01GM104483],National Library of Medicine(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This work is supported by grants from the National Library of Medicine (R01LM011945), and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (R01GM104483).",,36,10,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0009-9236,1532-6535,,CLIN PHARMACOL THER,Clin.

Additional lines of evidence may shed light on the nature of these differences. We measured neural activation in homosexual and heterosexual men and women using fMRI while they viewed three kinds of gendered sexual stimuli: pictures of nude individuals, pictures of same-sex couples interacting, and videos of individuals self-stimulating. The primary neural region of interest was the ventral striatum (VS), an area of central importance for reward processing. For all three kinds of stimuli and for both VS activation and self-report, men's responses were more closely related to their sexual orientations compared with women's. Furthermore, men showed a much greater tendency to respond more positively to stimuli featuring one sex than to stimuli featuring the other sex, leading to higher correlations among men's responses as well as higher correlations between men's responses and their sexual orientations. Whole-brain analyses identified several other regions showing a similar pattern to the VS, and none showed an opposite pattern. Because fMRI is measured identically in men and women, our results provide the most direct evidence to date that men's sexual arousal patterns are more gender specific than women's.","[Safron, Adam; Klimaj, Victoria; Rosenthal, A.

However, complexity has been defined in many ways by multiple different fields: here, we investigate measures of algorithmic and process complexity in both the temporal and topological domains, testing them on functional MRI BOLD signal data obtained from individuals undergoing various levels of sedation with the anaesthetic agent propofol, replicating our results in two separate datasets. We demonstrate that the various measures are differently able to discriminate between levels of sedation, with temporal measures showing higher sensitivity. Further, we show that all measures are strongly related to a single underlying construct explaining most of the variance, as assessed by Principal Component Analysis, which we interpret as a measure of overall complexity of our data. This overall complexity was also able to discriminate between levels of sedation and serum concentrations of propofol, supporting the hypothesis that consciousness is related to complexity - independent of how the latter is measured.","[Varley, Thomas F.; Luppi, Andrea I.; Pappas, Ioannis; Adapa, Ram; Menon, David K.; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, England; [Varley, Thomas F.; Luppi, Andrea I.; Pappas, Ioannis; Stamatakis, Emmanuel A.] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge, England; [Naci, Lorina] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland; [Naci, Lorina; Owen, Adrian M.] Univ Western Ontario, Brain & Mind Inst, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Varley, Thomas F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pappas, Ioannis] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Menon, David K.] Univ Cambridge, Wolfson Brain Imaging Ctr, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Trinity College Dublin; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Cambridge,"Varley, TF (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Div Anaesthesia, Cambridge, England.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge, England.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Varley, TF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",tvarley@iu.edu,"Owen, Adrian/B-4997-2015; Luppi, Andrea/JXN-3286-2024; Menon, David/AEX-7615-2022; Adapa, Ram/D-7925-2012","Stamatakis, Emmanuel Andreas/0000-0001-6955-9601; Adapa, Ram/0000-0002-9845-8532; Naci, Lorina/0000-0001-9630-3978; Owen, Adrian M/0000-0002-5738-3765; Luppi, Andrea I./0000-0002-3461-6431","Wellcome Trust [083660/Z/07/Z]; Canada Excellence Research Chairs program [215063]; Canadian Institute for Advanced research (CIFAR); Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Senior Investigator Awards; Stephen Erskine Fellowship at Queens' College, Cambridge; L'Oreal-Unesco for Women in Science Excellence Research Fellowship; British Oxygen Professorship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists; Gates Cambridge Trust; Oon Khye Beng Ch'Hia Tsio Studentship for Research in Preventive Medicine; Complex Networks & Systems NSF Research Traineeship [1735095]; NIHR Brain Injury Healthcare Technology Co-operative based at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of Cambridge; Wellcome Trust [083660/Z/07/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Canada Excellence Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs); Canadian Institute for Advanced research (CIFAR)(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Senior Investigator Awards; Stephen Erskine Fellowship at Queens' College, Cambridge; L'Oreal-Unesco for Women in Science Excellence Research Fellowship(L'Oreal Group); British Oxygen Professorship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists; Gates Cambridge Trust; Oon Khye Beng Ch'Hia Tsio Studentship for Research in Preventive Medicine; Complex Networks & Systems NSF Research Traineeship; NIHR Brain Injury Healthcare Technology Co-operative based at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of Cambridge(University of Cambridge); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)","This work was supported by a grant from the Wellcome Trust: Clinical Research Training Fellowship [to R.A.] (Contract grant number: 083660/Z/07/Z); from the Canada Excellence Research Chairs program (215063) and the Canadian Institute for Advanced research (CIFAR)[to A.M.O.]; Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and NIHR Senior Investigator Awards [to D.K.M.], the Stephen Erskine Fellowship at Queens' College, Cambridge [to E.A.S.], the L'Oreal-Unesco for Women in Science Excellence Research Fellowship [to L.N.]; the British Oxygen Professorship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists [to D.K.M.]; the Gates Cambridge Trust [to A.I.L.]; the Oon Khye Beng Ch'Hia Tsio Studentship for Research in Preventive Medicine, administered via Downing College, University of Cambridge [to I.P.]; the Complex Networks & Systems NSF Research Traineeship (grant 1735095) [to T.F.V.].
