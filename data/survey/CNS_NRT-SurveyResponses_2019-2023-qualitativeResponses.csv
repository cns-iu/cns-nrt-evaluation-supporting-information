2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,Also assign a current PhD or postdoc to mentor.
2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"At times, my mentor has been relatively inaccessible. Things have settled down quite a bit, but over the period of the past year, there have been blocks when my mentor just really didn't seem to be available. Now that that has eased, things are much better. Lets hope it stays that way. "
2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"Many mentors do not have an awareness of how the other program or mentor in another discipline may be at odds with their goals. Students are pulled in multiple directions because advisors can't accept that their area of expertise may not be relevant to a student at every time in their progression through the program. Sometimes they need to step back and let students work on a project that they don't understand, instead of trying to shape the project into something they do understand, or forcing the student to take on an additional project."
2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,I liked how this year all of the lab meeting windows were sent out in a clear document for Complex systems. 
2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"I am referring largely to my 2nd major advisor here. Within Informatics, there has been much less support. "
2020,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,Give students mentors
2021,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"Be more flexible with who counts as ""core informatics faculty."""
2021,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,Its hard to believe that mentorship couldn't always be somewhat improved. Relationships always require work and a mentoring relationship is no different in that respect than any other relationship. Availability is often a struggle in the grad student-faculty relationship.
2021,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"This question is very weird to answer because mentorship is extremely circumstantial, due to department connections, interpersonal relationships, etc. I think the NRT could use coaches for people who are struggling to find mentors or need help navigating cross-departmental issues. (This person/these people would NEED to be external to the NRT program.) At the very least, it would probably be helpful to people who haven't found good mentors if they had a chance to get advice. "
2021,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"Perhaps a fault of the pandemic, but I could have used more frequent check ins and more support from the department when choosing/meeting with an advisor. It has been difficult to coordinate between my two departments and I feel like as a result I haven't had strong mentorship in either."
2022,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"A huge amount depends on the mentor - I got lucky, but many many of my friends don't feel the same way. "
2022,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"I don't know how helpful this is as a generalized critique of mentorship, but I'd like to express some issues I've been facing over the course of my time here. 

Although I think the complex systems program here is one of the strongest in the country, I still feel like it's hard to find a mentor in complex systems who is willing to give me the space to engage with my subject domain. If CX represents the methodological approach side of the degree, then I feel like the methodologists keep trying to prioritize methods over subject. In my case, since most of the CX faculty here are focused on networks, I often feel like any suggestions or issues I bring up related to social psychology (my domain) are dismissed if it impedes ""just pushing the network model to run"". From their perspective, it doesn't make sense to complicate model parameters or mechanisms if it works well enough to predict data, even if the model is nonsensical from the standpoint of the system they're modeling. 
I think students recognize this. I've heard many times from my fellow NRT trainees that they want to work with one or two particular professors because of their openness and willingness to engage with the subject matter, or at least listen and step out of the way when a student is bringing important content to the project. 

Just for clarification, I'm mostly referring to the professors whose primary departments are CX. The cross-listed professors are probably more likely to feel embedded in their own subject field and thus won't advise people outside of it, which is a different exclusion criterion (eg, a social scientist crosslisted in CX won't take on a student who studies brain networks because of the field difference). "
2022,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"There should be less effort pushing students into one lab or another, to one mentor or another. This is not the intention of the NRT, but some faculty made it feel as such."
2023,Q27T,Doctoral Fellows,Improve the CNS NRT Program,"more opportunities to interact with other mentors, like panels"
2020,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"I just need to thank my mentors any chance I get, because they have been incredibly understanding of my wide variety of circumstances that have held back my research for quite a while. I greatly appreciate their support, and I think they are representative of the wonderful kindness and excellent interdisciplinary professorship at IU. "
2020,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,I never received an NRT mentor. That could have been helpful!
2021,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,I haven't made progress in finding a mentor for my interest in public service and public policy since the start of the pandemic. 
2021,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"I want to stress that my glowing review is specific to just my mentor. In general, my experience with the core Complex Systems faculty at Informatics has been, in many respects, less than stellar. Several core NRT faculty in Informatics are difficult to work with, inconsistent, and over-demanding. "
2021,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,I think the research rotation process could have been better explained as well as the process for getting a second advisor. 
2021,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,My mentors in both my programs are amazing. I am extremely fortunate to have them.
2022,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"I'm not sure how you know who my primary mentor is, since my mentor is in my second degree. I'm going to assume this survey isn't about a particular person. "
2022,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"It's a very informal process so I""m not sure what could be changed at the institutional level? "
2022,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"I was actually told at my previous IDP meeting by [NRT PI] and my former advisor that it really didn't seem like I knew what I was doing, and that because my advisors didn't show up (they were honestly caught off guard with the time switch that had happened). It was very dissappointing experience, because I had been working hard, and have excellent mentorship by both faculty I work with as my advisors/mentors. The comments made towards ""switching"", were the fact that I had dabbled and tried to work with different mentors until I found the right fit. It was not a matter of ""completion of projects"". Many students switch advisors later on in their PhD, which is a much costlier decision that I think the NRT should allow for in the first two years. That would truly highlight such a benefit of the NRT. I think the true affordance here in such a program is to allow students to pursue much more risky decisions, and not necessarily to be ""productive scientists"" off the bat, but build skills that may be overlooked given typical pressures of programs. 

This semester alone, I have submitted a couple abstracts, two papers, and have plans for 3 or 4 more ready for submission by the end of the year. Given the comments made at the last IDP, I do not think they represented me well as a researcher or a student. I think the NRT funding allowing me to take more risks and be more careful with my decision, was the biggest benefit I had, allowing me to pursue research like I do now, with the mentors I have chosen now."
2023,Q29,Doctoral Fellows,Fellow-Mentorship Impact,"I didn't have much (or any) of a(n) (in)formal mentorship relationship with faculty. This isn't a complaint or concern. I spent the vast majority of my time at IU outside INFO, so it would natural that there wasn't much occasion to connect with faculty. "
2020,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,Time management; stress management
2020,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,I believe that the mentee has been able to make numerous new connections with students and faculty - I strive to get students to maximize these contact so they can benefit from multiple perspectives and approaches.
2020,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,"Sometimes learning things like perseverance and optimism are important too, but they may not make it into publications, presentations and grants in an obvious way. "
2020,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,"Networking, professional development, interdisciplinary viewpoints, diversity"
2021,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,They have been in my graduate methods course & have acquired skills with a new technique that they did not know about previously.
2021,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,contributions to interdisciplinary research
2021,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,I think we also discussed how to assess the research field and what projects to pick. 
2021,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,"To understand the broad spectrum of disciplines, questions and approaches that constitute networks and compleity science."
2022,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,"We talked about grant-writing skills and, eventually, how to transform experiences as a PhD student into careers."
2023,Q36T,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Help,Successfully transition to a postdoc
2020,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,"One of the things I most like about NRT students is that they are broad thinkers, coming at problems from many different approaches. I learn from them too!"
2020,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,The heavy additional course load of the NRT has been a drag on my student's scientific / publication productivity. 
2020,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,Student just arrived
2021,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,"The NRT mentoring experience is by its necessity, a multi-disciplinary exercise. Student committees have varied membership & they learn to work with people from many other disciplines. This should be sold as a strength of the program."
2021,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact," I really love the interdisciplinary nature of this program. I think it makes people more creative and open minded about research, forcing them to think outside of the usual boundaries, so they are less likely to pick typical questions that each subfield is concerned with. This can lead to greater insights, I think."
2021,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,Student switched advisor before making much progress
2021,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,"The participation of the social sciences in this program here represents a real strength in terms of the next generation of students understanding how to cross from one discipline to another, to see the strengths and weaknesses among them, and learn how to synthesize the best aspects to answers critical questions."
2022,Q38,Faculty,Faculty-Mentorship Impact,I do not have an NRT student. I realize that we cannot all have students. But I have felt isolated from everyone because COVID has not made it safe for people to congregate face to face.
2020,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Communication generally
2020,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,One of the most helpful things about the showcase is the chance to better understand the work of my colleagues and what they are using this program for.
2020,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Preparing to discuss work outside of IU in the larger academic community.
2020,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,I had to condense months of work into a 5 minute presentation and have the narrative be meaningful and compelling to those outside of my research area. 
2021,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,"Making the presentation was a challenge - fitting my work into 5 and 2 minutes respectively is difficult AND reflects how research is often presented. Honing the skill of getting to the most salient and impactful points of research (especially in a somewhat general audience) is a skill well worth developing. Hopefully I get helpful and constructive comments on my presentation. Also - preparing for the showcase gave me an opportunity to reflect on my work over the last and that by itself was helpful. As researchers, we have to know where we have explored as much as where we are attempting to go. Finally, participating in the showcase gave me many different points of view on how to present work as well as what ""summary of work"" means. Of course, also, it was very cool, encouraging, and interesting to know what others were doing. It made me feel like I was part of a much bigger community working towards similar goals."
2021,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Helped me develop an elevator pitch and how to present a condensed version of my research.
2021,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,"Presentation skills, improved ""elevator pitch"""
2021,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Giving elevator speech is a useful skill
2021,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,"Concretize work for future publications, just maybe not immediately."
2022,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,presenting to an audience with diverse interests and backgrounds
2022,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,"It primarily just makes presenting a more routine part of the research experience. I don't really get the sense that most presentation advice emphasizes taking steps to make presenting an act of ease and repetition. I think there's value in helping researchers understand the presentations are constant and routine, rather than spikes of display or grandeur. But this is something I learned from putting up with research posters sessions. It could be emphasized more explicitly to take the mental burden off the event. "
2022,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,It helped me synthesize my research for the dissertation proposal. IT helped me with presentation skills.
2022,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Communicate with people from different disciplines
2022,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,Presentation and research 
2023,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,it helped me hone my skills in presenting my research to a variety of audiences
2023,Q53a,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Skill Advancement,It gave me experience that I wouldn't have had otherwise
2020,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,I generally have not had the impression that the annual research showcase is intended to develop student skills in any way. My most positive and memorable interactions during the showcases were with the professors I was collaborating with on the research. 
2020,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,I didn't submit my work to the showcase.
2020,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"I will always be doing research and preparing presentations, so this isn't particularly novel in process"
2020,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,I had most of the skills the showcase develops from my masters. 
2020,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"It could have been live, with actual viewers. I submitted the Showcase as an annual requirement but never received any feedback. As far as I know, it wasn't shared with anyone."
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"This is not the fault of the showcase, but the fact that it had to be virtual required everyone to present for only 2 minutes. It felt very rushed and rather pointless. Again, a poster session would have alleviated these issues. I have attended virtual con"
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"It is really another item that students have to do, it isn't structured to help students, rather to disseminate information. It is also difficult because the interests of students and faculty vary significantly and the subject background is highly variable making meaningful discussion have a long on-boarding time.  "
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"Despite making the required video, I got no useful feedback. I'm not sure anyone watched it. "
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"(These comments acknowledge that the pandemic has negatively affected everyone that is part of the NRT, from the admin staff to the professors to the students.)
It might be helpful to guide the presentation process for students, especially new students. Currently the showcase just feels like a chore, and I never talk to anyone in any meaningful capacity unless they're already working on the project I'm presenting. If the goal is to teach how to present and network, some guidance might be needed, especially for new students. "
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,It has to be longer than two minutes per student. I've never been asked a question or received any feedback from the virtual showcases. I've also never increased my understanding of other students' research through the showcases.
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,Better mentoring and clearer NRT milestones
2021,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,This format is pointless. It's basically only NRT affiliated faculty that come and rapid two-minute presentations are hard to follow. It felt like a waste of time to me and I didn't really get a sense of what other people are doing because it's way too compressed. I think less rigid research talks would be much better.
2022,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,I hadn't joined a research at the tinder of the showcase
2022,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"The last two years, we have made videos, sent them off into the digital void, and that was it. This years was okay b/c we actually could talk to people, but we still never got feedback or any sense of why were doing it. "
2022,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"Communicate what I'm doing with other grad students after COVID, so that collaborations can be sparked"
2022,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"A lot of the showcase for me was work I had already done. Because there had been disengagement this past year, I don't think my skills were advanced by the showcase, but they were advanced prior to the showcase, and it was a way to show the growth I had."
2023,Q53b,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-Improvement,"Rather than a showcase, force participants to give a 10 minute blurb on their research to everyone else. "
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I think that organizing a poster/presentation workshop prior to the event would greatly help students, especially those who do not have much experience presenting in this manner. "
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"This is difficult to say when it's been so disrupted by COVID, but I like that in theory the showcase is flexible. It's an opportunity for everyone in the NRT to come together without the level of pressure of, say, a conference."
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,Always got great feedback from fellows and faculty. Used much of it in revising my research idea.
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I would like to know more about the purpose and intended audience next time. I basically did my best guess. Without knowing the purpose and audience for the presentation, it is difficult to optimize the presentation to that goal and audience. Also, having to guess the purpose of the presentation made me wonder if there was no purpose, which was disheartening given the work that I felt like I needed to put into it. "
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"We submitted videos for the showcase in 2020 and have never gotten feedback, seen any of the materials our peers proposed, or gotten any acknowledgement of the work we did in any way. "
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,The showcase is pretty insular and only people that are already aware of the NRT show up. I think it's pointless.
2020,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I understand that the Showcase had to be virtual this year, but it should have been cancelled if there wasn't also going to be time or space for feedback."
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,The Zoom-based methodology simply doesn't work. I cannot synthesize my work down to 120 seconds. Perhaps a virtual poster session would make more sense. 
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"It was very cool, encouraging, and interesting to know what others were doing. It made me feel like I was part of a much bigger community working towards similar goals. Having all that information presented at once and in an interactive fashion was fantast"
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I generally have a very negative view of the showcase. I personally don't see it as providing any benefit for students, and I see it largely as a way to show off the students to NSF evaluators. Just to be clear, this would be totally fine if I felt like this goal was being communicated to us honestly. I understand that evaluation is a big part of this program, and if it were honestly pitched to me as a way to show all that we have, I would feel like intentions are clear and honest. It would be a way to rally students to show off. As it is, the annual showcase does not make any sense as a way to benefit students because we spend all our time trying to make our presentations that we generally don't get a chance to even see our peer's work (in-person or online). And because of the interdisciplinary nature of the work, we are forced to cater to too many audiences. Either we pitch too high and no one understands us, or we pitch too low and no one in our field things our work is interesting. 

I do acknowledge that, for students who joined after the pandemic started, the showcase in spring 2021 was one of few events that helped them feel connected to the program. "
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I understand that it's usually a poster presentation, but I really believe it needs to be a series of talks to be useful. Anything less than that doesn't give listeners or the researcher enough time and space to really delve into the nuances of the research at hand."
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,A useful opportunity to reconnect with everyone else in the program
2021,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,Make it voluntary and don't force students to present work that is not ready to be presented yet. This is especcially important for newer students who are often quite stressed by having to present something at the research showcase.
2022,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,It was a great way to see everyone else's research
2022,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"I liked this year's event, but possibly because it made up for some issues in lack of contact or research discussions between different years of NRT students. "
2022,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,More timely communication about showcase requirements (e.g. learning about poster requirements less than a week out from print date was not ideal).
2022,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"This year we were given far too little notice for the showcase presentation. I'm glad it was fairly informal, which relieved some of the pressure, but suddenly having to put together a presentation in such a short time was a big stressor. "
2022,Q56,Doctoral Fellows,Research Showcase-General Comments,"It was nice to finally do things in person. To be honest, it had felt like mostly a chore for many of us when done online, and it did not feel like our work was taken seriously. This definitely was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,I chose yes because I do think it could be improved but I don't actually have any suggestions. I just wish that we students weren't so busy so we could dedicate more time to it. 
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,invite speakers with broader appeal
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,I would be very happy to see more colloquia once it's possible to do so
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,More student involvement in selection process (that's already in the works)
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,I really like the series. Sometimes the talks have been spaced a little too closely together but I also understand that the program can't control the outside speakers schedules.
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"Work with other departments to have joint colloquium more often, it is more coordination work, but I think it would speak to the program better."
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"It is very spotty - some semesters it just doesn't seem to happen. Also more relevant speakers. I proposed a number of speakers, and reached out to some personally, but the NRT administrators dropped the ball and nothing ever happened. "
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,More diversity in terms of fields although I know it's hard to schedule these events.
2020,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,Invite more social scientists.
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,Invite more scholars from social science 
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,It would be great to have opportunities for networking at these events
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"The speakers who come have really focused on academic research questions and queuing individuals to go into academics. I don't want to go into academics, I want to go into public service. There hasn't been anyone who has presented research in this realm (or in the realm of industry, excluding private research foundations)."
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"Bring in more ""core complex systems science"" researchers, instead of just scientists who happen to use a few CX method. "
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"I would like to hear from individuals who have followed post-PhD research and career paths that deviate from work at R1 universities. This could include individuals from primarily teaching institutions and private, government and non-profit institutions as"
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"I'm sure there are ways, but I don't have any suggestions. I generally like them, and I regret not being able to make all of them. "
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"I would have liked an intro session which described academia in more detail, and, how to best utilize discussion sessions with professors. "
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"More interdisciplinary. The talks are rarely relevant to my research, but are frequent enough that I have to miss them often because I need to prioritize things that advance my own research."
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"I would like to see speakers who have diverse training backgrounds. I also want to see more applied work, e.g. network neuroscience."
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,I see more tech-y people than humanity scholars.
2021,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"More female speakers, more diversity in speakers. This is strongly lacking. Also, student feedback about speakers hasn't been taken very seriously, in all honesty."
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"fewer speakers with physics backgrounds, since so few NRT students actually have a physics background. when all the speakers have training that most of us don't and won't ever have, that just makes us feel isolated from the field."
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"Bring more ""pure"" complexity/mathematics/stat mech people. Not just people who happen to be using networks on interesting domain-specific questions. "
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,See comments about COVID impact. We have had almost no colloquia this year so it's hard to comment about the impact of something that doesn't exist. 
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"I think the colloquium series was one of the most difficult things to organize during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic we had been working to involve students more in selecting speakers, and making the events regular. That said, I think that at that point they were actually TOO frequent. Between reading the paper, meeting about it, and attending the colloquium, that added quite a bit of work, which was difficult for students already fulfilling two degree requirements."
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,Better organizing seminars/ having dates/times in more advanced notice. 
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,Get more speakers from social science fields
2022,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,"Numerous times, students had requested invites for particular speakers. Though many speakers were interesting to us, most of them, if any, were ones students had voted for interest in. I do think the colloquium series pre-stuff (e.g. paper discussions and time with professors), were incredibly helpful and insightful though, and do appreciate that."
2023,Q62a,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-Improvement,a broader variety of speaker backgrounds 
2020,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,I am happy with the colloquium. As an early student I am not building new collaborations but I can see room for it in the future
2020,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,"I know this is something that is being adapted. I like the range of speakers we bring in, and appreciate the chance to meet them in informal settings over lunch as well as attending the talk."
2020,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,"While I marked ""disagree"" to the prompt ""Participating at the NRT Extended Colloquium Series has helped to form new research collaborations."", I would say that more than anything it has just not helped me with that. It might in the future and the opportunity just hasn't arisen yet. And I have lots of collaborators here so I feel like it would be challenging to get involved in more at this time. Also, I always learn something new. I feel like the extended colloquium series may not have resulted in ""research collaborations"" but it certainly results in ""knowledge"" collaborations - with the students, with students to the folks who lead the paper talk/review, and with students to the outside speaker. And sometimes that is more just about life skills in academy. sometimes it has felt like i have a new advisor for an hour and that we all discuss and brainstorm ideas (about any topic) together.   I really like the Extended Colloquium Series and look forward to their return to in person whenever it is possible and look forward to being part of the eSeries this fall."
2021,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,I liked the variety and breadth of topics and speakers you chose for the colloquia this year
2021,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,"The virtual format has been great! Obviously it is different than in person, but comes with advantages such as easing ability to attend on both the speakers and student participants. I would be happy to continue having colloquiums in this format if it was "
2021,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,"Colloquium feels very much like its only trying to satisfy the goals of the professors rather than the students. I will say, a great part of the colloquium for students has been conversations with various professors. I would love to highlight the sessions "
2022,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,I don't have any
2023,Q64,Doctoral Fellows,Rearch Colloquium-General Comments,"I come from a discipline where there are colloquium like talks every week. I'm not sure if this is the place to make this suggestion, but introducing ""brown-bag"" talks might really help connect students and faculty alike with a wider range of research ques"
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I think it has been wonderful, extremely stimulating!"
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,more summer activities if possible
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,So grateful to be a part of this program. Thank you!
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"Overall good, but it adds a lot of course / programmatic overhead that ultimately reduces the student's scientific productivity. Do the extra course benefits outweigh the costs of slowed publication (and ultimately slowed time to graduation)? Postdocs get hired for their papers, not for the courses they took. "
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I am the external evaluator for the NRT and have limited direct experience of the program. That said, I have access to all of the evaluative data about the program and can make a reasoned judgment about it based on those data. I believe the NRT is evolving very nicely and that it will continue to grow in impact."
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,The program has allowed for an increased perspective of Complex systems in the joint departments that students are in. I think the other faculty and graduate students in other programs have benefited from having this slightly different perspective/opportunity for new collaborations. 
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"IT appears to be a great program for broadening participation in computing to include diverse populations, perspectives, and inclusive approaches."
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,The fellowships for international students are way too low. The discrepancy in funding for doing the same work that US nationals do is really frustrating. Living on the fellowship is hard.
2020,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"The strength of the NRT program is in the student community that formed around it. The actual courses have been, in my experience, quite weak. My discussion courses have been unproductive and largely driven by a few men who make it nearly impossible for women to chime in. The program itself struggles to be interdisciplinary and focuses largely on biology and cognitive science / neuroscience. I've been disappointed, overall, with this program and would not recommend it to someone outside of biology and cognitive science / neuroscience."
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"The talks that have been made possible by the NRT (colloquium speakers, student poster sessions, etc) have been very impactful on my own thoughts and interest in complex networks.I had been interested in a casual fashion but have since engaged in substantial work that resulted in publications with direct application to complex networks and systems."
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"Being affiliated with the program was amazing, and will provide insight, connections, and knowledge of tools and topics for many years to come. 5/5 for the experience, and a million thank you's for the opportunity to be a part of this!"
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,My experience has been positive. Keep up the good work...
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,Interacting with other students within the program is the best and most useful part of the program.
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"Given how the NRT was virtual this year, it was difficult to meet with students organically outside of the colloquiums and lab meetings. I appreciate the effort taken by the staff and faculty to accommodate us during the pandemic. "
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,I am really grateful for the opportunity and complex systems will definitely inform my dissertation.
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I haven't been so involved with the program this past year, so please feel free to discard my replies."
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I have had a great experience with the NRT. I could not do the research I'm interested in without the structure that allows me to be in two departments, as well as the support that allows me to take this many classes. My biggest issue with the program is a lack of training in the actual methods and tools of complex systems. My second biggest issue is a lack of support for those of us navigating between very different departments, both in terms of what paperwork to fill out, and how to structure research."
2021,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,The funding for international students is really bad and we miss out on a lot of funding opportunities that US citizens have. Being on the NRT fellowship left me in a position where I experienced significant financial hardship. There was also no way to generate additional income because the fellowship restricts us from working as a research assistant. I don't see any differences in terms of mentoring but being an international student in this program feels like being a second-class participant whose work is valued much less than of my American peers considering how much less we get paid despite the same expectations. It would be nice to not live in poverty.
2022,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,Thank you! Both my research in general and my dissertation in particular benefitted from the NRT program!
2022,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I really like all my fellow trainees. I think the program did a good job at getting cool people into one place to put forward interesting research. I don't know if this is a consequence or coincidence of the program, but I'm very glad I participated, despite whatever my feelings are about the hiccups with the program. "
2022,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,"I'm really grateful for the NRT. I've had a hard time feeling connected to and supported by the program during the pandemic, but I still think it's given me a lot and I hope it continues!"
2022,Q107,All Participants,General Comments,I really like this program. Thank you 
2020,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I have not been permitted to attend the classes up until now, 3 weeks since the start of the classes."
2020,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"Although I think that CNS at IU is a very, very strong network science program, my overall impression of its engagement in complex systems ideas broadly is less than stellar. For the most part, I haven't felt that there has been space for discussion of the epistemology of complex systems. This is crucial to understanding how tools like network science (as a subset of the tools of complex systems) pushes the boundaries of current knowledge, or fails to address particular issues. I think this is crucial for complex systems topics which are not comprehensively modeled by networks, like social systems. "
2020,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"The offered (and required) course work is largely disappointing. I learned far more on my own: courses are a distracting time-sink. Fewer courses, or better courses would be an improvement. "
2020,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I think the NRT program really benefits students in the Cognitive and other brain sciences, but it doesn't do a great job with students in the social sciences. It's been immensely difficult to find anything of relevance to my field in the courses I've taken so far (besides I501) and there are so few collaborations with social scientists that it's difficult to find anyone to consult with about the intersection of the social sciences and complex systems. "
2021,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"The CNS major of the NRT seems to be rather vague and disorganized, and the required courses have to cater to people who are extremely nontechnical. In most complex systems programs, the work is based on physics and math, but we this program is unable to incorporate the necessary training because of the enormous diversity of background of the students."
2021,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"The core courses for the complex systems track at IU lack foundational, mathematically rigorous content. Why is there no class on computational approaches to dynamical systems? Why is there no class on information theory, statistical mechanics, or any of the mathematical foundations for complex systems (beyond YY's Network Science course, which is truly excellent). 

I feel like the program engaged in ""false advertising"" to an extent. Almost every ""technical"" skill I have developed has been self-directed learning, while the core course work has been more appropriate to a philosophy department. This is not what I signed up for. "
2021,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"In my experience, the NRT by its nature puts strains on the current silo'd bureaucracies represented in departments. As a result, it seems to me like many student's mileage will vary a lot depending entirely on their expectations. If they entered into the program intending to do a degree between two departments that do not play well together, and they expected it to be easier than it is, it would impact their satisfaction. By its nature, this program uses students to cut against departmental norms. I happen to be satisfied because my departments play well together. That isn't an indication of the program, though, because the program has relatively little leverage in pushing a department to accept certain students or work with them in ways that make sense for the student. "
2021,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I generally feel like the CNS NRT program is low on methods courses and seminars, and this has led to a huge gap between me and other students who came into the program with more training in methods."
2021,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"My understanding coming into the program was that through the CNS NRT program I would receive training on a variety of methods. So far, all of my methods training has come from my second program. I really wanted more training in applied math and computational approaches through CNS. As it stands, I don't think I'm getting the training I need in order to be successful in CNS as a field. The fact that almost all of the NRT colloquium speakers have PhDs in physics reinforces this. I really want to see speakers with diverse training backgrounds."
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,I felt likeadvising could have been better
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,It is baffling to me that there aren't more methods classes available for NRT students. This is such an important part of my training.
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"The required courses lacked technical rigor (with the exception of YYs class). I don't feel like I learned much in the way of useful skills for analyzing data or building models. It was all ""conceptual""."
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I am dissatisfied with my phd program milestones but this is largely due to personal factors (largely related to mental health around work). Therapy has made me feel a lot better and more capable of handling my work, so this isn't actually related to the NRT program directly. "
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I felt personally that being between two departments allowed me to ""fall through the cracks"" moving towards my PhD, which was mostly my responsibility, but I think I would be less behind if there were a clearer structure of administration and mentorship so I had known who to contact when I started falling behind. Also I wish we had more technical skills based required classes."
2022,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"I am not satisfied with the NRT program - rather than the CNS program. I am very satisfied with my two departments and their mentorship, but the NRT has not really given good opportunities to improve skills or develop students as researchers outside of the opportunities they receive in their own labs and departments. There were a few events that were useful, and mostly planned by  [NRT Project Manager], who definitely deserves credit. But it seemed like there could have been more and there was not enough effort to support [NRT Project Manager] in [their] efforts."
2023,Q133,Doctoral Fellows,General Comments,"i wish more methods courses were available in complex systems, or least additional opportunities for training in complex systems methods."
2020,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,I think this part of the survey would vary wildly between students. My fields are very open to interdisciplinary conversation so it has been easier for me to pursue. 
2020,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"Simply the fact that this program and grant allows me to work in two very different fields simultaneously is essential to my research. It could not be done without being fully in both departments, with an advisor in each."
2020,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"I marked my responses as best I could although I feel like my research is still developing so some were answered with what I hope to do rather than what I have done already. I hope that I can respond more confidently next year.   I think that my NRT experience has greatly expanded my knowledge of points of view and research other than my own and how those can all add together to create something really insightful, impactful, and actionable. Furthermore, that those different perspectives are needed to bring that insight, impact, and action. Also, I have seen how ""glib"" interdisciplinarity that is truly informed by those with deep expertise in the field of study can lead communities down false paths. ID research is a commitment to bringing all collaborators on as equals and hearing one another; ID research is not just applying techniques from one area to another and generating results that may or may not be meaningful. "
2020,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"I've been fortunate to meet students in other fields who have introduced me to interdisciplinary methods and theories. I haven't had this experience with any faculty or speakers, though."
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"As for my own research, while I used to think that my work has direct methodologial applications for complex systems science, through my NRT experience I have learned that it's not that easy. When you tackle problems within your own subfield you imagine people in other fields have not addressed those issues -- often they have, and there are reasons why no one has done what you thought was easy to do. On the other hand, I feel like I am better informed and closer to making those connections than I was one year ago, and am positive that they are feasible, albeit not necessarily easy."
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"It is really hard to do if there is not a common goal. I am less hopeful for interdisciplinary work in academics because the incentive structures in the academy is not focused on a common goal associated with the problem at hand, rather the goals are associated with funding and publications. "
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"""I enjoy tackling the challenges posed by working on complex problems, even if doing so requires me to expend extra time and effort."" - I certainly enjoy this but that doesn't mean I have the time to do it. 

""I am willing to invest the time required for learning about fields that are different from my own"" - I see this when I participate in the Extended Colloquia. That doesn't mean that I actually have the time/resources to do this beyond the colloquia. Sometimes even active participation in the colloquia is a stretch. I am willing to do this - but I still have limits. 

Being in Informatics has greatly expanded my understanding and appreciation for the huge number of ways to gather knowledge about the world around us and the human experience. It has been very valuable. Being in CNS and seeing how one can take these ways of gather knowledge and synthesis them via computational and mathematical frameworks and (sometimes) generalize beyond the systems under study has been awesome . The Extended Colloquia also give me constant exposure to people and ideas outside of my area of intense focus and bring in new perspectives and  foster new conceptual connections and maybe most importantly, just keep me grounded in the human meaning and impacts of research. "
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"It's so valuable and yet so difficult. I realized that even the speakers who tackle the same subject as I, bring perspectives that can completely diverge from my own. This is not just a matter of different results or different methods, but even different questions being asked."
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"The NRT has been GREAT for fostering interdisciplinarity. However, I wish there were more methods classes, rather than working always at a conceptual level that assumes we already have strong grounding in the tools of complex systems."
2021,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"Being exposed to more ""interdisciplinary"" labelled research has shown me that many people claim to be interdisciplinary but don't really engage with the other peoples work which is quite disappointing."
2022,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,Doesn't this page of the survey suffer from a lot of social desirability effects? I can't tell what 'interdisciplinarity' means here. 
2022,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"The ability to be in both departments has deeply influenced my research, and allowed me to really feel like I'm getting the wide-ranging expertise I need to do the research I want."
2022,Q147,Doctoral Fellows,Interdisciplinarity-Program Impact,"As mentioned, the NRT has given me the funding to pursue more risky decisions -- so from that point of view, it has allowed me to really invest in interdisciplanarity. Some programs with the colloquium series have helped too. That being said, the overall NRT program internally hasn't made that much of an impact. It really has been my mentors, plus the affordance to take risks, along with colloquium that has allowed this."
2020,Q154,Summer Affiliates,Affliate Program-Comments,"For context, I am an affiliate just this summer. There were not many NRT activities during the summer, so currently I do not feel like I have really interacted with other NRT fellows/affiliates. Thus, aside from the funding I got from the NRT program, I do not feel like I am part of the NRT community. That said, the grant is very helpful in letting me focus on my research, and I appreciate it very much."
2021,Q154,Summer Affiliates,Affliate Program-Comments,"Why not have several mentors instead of only one listed supervisor?

E.g. pool abstracts from summer affiliates in early fall, share with faculty, give each student 3-5 slots that faculty can take (people interested in chatting with student); if no one interested in student's work random assign. This could just be one chat, not binding commitment to mentor."
2021,Q154,Summer Affiliates,Affliate Program-Comments,"I didn't really get to know other students from the program. Of course I saw most of them on Zoom during the paper discussions etc., but that's not the right setting to get to know each other. I'm sure this is easier to solve in person, but it was something that struck me during the later discussions where it was clear that the NRT students knew each other from class."
2021,Q154,Summer Affiliates,Affliate Program-Comments,"The timing of the program was really challenging. The fellowship notice came really late, so I had already agreed to do other work, but was also teaching in the fall and needed to do lots of prep for that. Once the semester began, I wasn't really able to work on much either so I never got to take the time to really get into the research I was doing. Other than that, it was really hard to get to know people during the pandemic, so it might have been primarily that that I found challenging."
2022,Q154,Summer Affiliates,Affliate Program-Comments,The affiliates were not involved in any additional soft-skills training or industry-oriented training.
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,COVID has made it impossible for normal interactions to take place. We have had to get used to COVID & learn how to make virtual interactions productive. I think that we have learned a lot in the last couple of years - of what to do & what not to do. I thi
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,Fewer interactions with collogues and so less awareness of what others are doing
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"Because I joined during the pandemic, I feel like many of my options were very limited, including interacting with other NRT students, talking with visiting speakers, getting to know NRT-affiliated faculty, and exploring my research options. Regardless of how much enthusiasm I or the speakers bring to a Zoom meeting, I never get as much out of them as in-person events."
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,There has been no ability to network with other people in the field of complex systems -- which was one of the main draws of the NRT for me (esp. connections with SFI and Northeastern).
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"Meeting on Zoom is just not the same as meeting in person. You won't have any of the unscripted, one-on-one conversations with faculty that you happen to run into at and around the event."
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"I get the impression that the lecture series, which was a bulk of NRT participation before the pandemic, was severely impacted by the pandemic and people's willingness to travel. This is understandable, but it means that newer NRT students basically did not get an NRT experience. I have put in some effort to getting to know newer students, and they make up a bulk of my current social circle. They have talked about how the money is great but there doesn't seem to be an NRT program, and I've expressed my own experience to them about how things were different before COVID. "
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,I wasn't very aware of things happening - had to make direct inquiries with [NRT Project Manager] to stay informed. 
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"All kinds of collaboration became much more difficult- students were no longer sharing workspace or having informal discussions. It was much more difficult to get in touch with professors, the virtual colloquia didn't allow for any kind of informal discussion (besides which there were just many fewer of them). The planned trips to visit other NRT programs were cancelled. The whole program had to be restructured and I think that was difficult for everyone, moving from a structure that was planned to one that was improvised. People in general retreated to their separate departments and the interdisciplinary spirit of the program was difficult to sustain. "
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,I feel that the pandemic has constrained the amount and quality of events during my participation.
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"I have two NRT students working in my lab (and work with others as part of collaborations). Meeting virtually is not always productive and, in my opinion, has slowed the training of some of these students."
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"It just made it harder to interact with folks regularly. Interactions had to be planned and organized, which was more difficult, Zoom fatigue, etc. "
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,I've missed going to the poster sessions and other presentations.
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"Also with respect to the previous responses. I feel like the NRT has really dropped the ball this past year. There was minimal support for us, lots of student organizing, which really should not have been the responsibility of students, but provided by the program. To this end, COVID seems to have really stunted the effectiveness of the program, either due to gaps in communication or lack of personnel, or lack of appreciation of personnel, including staff (like [NRT Project Manager], who planned events for us) and students."
2022,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,During Covid my workload has increased making me less available for participating in NRT activities.
2023,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,I entered the NRT program after masking was in decline and the pandemic was more of backward looking phenomena than it was a present scourge. 
2023,Q155,All Participants,COVID-Qual,"i began my phd in 2020, when all events and classes were taking place virtually. this drastically limited the extent to which i could network with other complex systems scientists at colloquia, conferences, events, and in classes. it slowed my degree progress."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"We will need to keep activities in hybrid format [in person + virtual] for the near future as we navigate the successive waves of COVID infections. This is not going away. Lab experiences etc. will need to be adapted - perhaps training video materials  will need to be made. Similarly, talks will likely be harder to do. The NRT program could also consider more overseas speakers for colloquia & make them online - let's make lemonade out of lemons. They cannot travel easily, so let's bring them to us virtually!"
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,I think they are necessary for a great CNS program
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"As mentioned earlier, I think the colloquium series should be adapted to include speakers who don't have a physics background. The NRT doesn't provide the training for us to fully understand what a physicist does, even one in complex systems, so it feels like a waste of my time to go to talks I barely understand by people whose trajectory through complex systems looks nothing like mine.  I also think the CNS research skills and training opportunities should be adapted, for a similar reason. I feel like the program is lacking in rigorous methodological training, which is really important to me to have. This was present in YY's network science class, but such training should not be limited to one class."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,The showcase has historically seemed largely pointless as we never get feedback on our projects (esp. virtual showcases). The colloquium speakers have rarely appealed to me. 
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"It was never fully clear what the interdisciplinary mentorship should encompass for affiliates. Since we don't take classes in complex systems, it's not as easy to forge strong mentorship relations with faculty."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"I don't feel like I understand this page. The wording says it's asking about adapting things to CX grad programs, but I don't even know how many CX grad programs there even are. And most of these things are really commonplace across grad programs in general (like getting speakers, showcasing research, having summer funding). 

The only thing I can say is that getting a dual degree is good in concept but in practice it can be a bureaucratic nightmare. It really just uses students as the battering ram to opening doors between departments, which might not be for the benefit of the student. "
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,I would like to see a careful assessment of what kinds of dual PHDs are feasible (not all are) and how to support students who want to pursue them.  
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"I think the opportunity to enroll in a dual-degree program is the most important part and I hope that remains something that IU supports- few other schools have this kind of support for that option of being in two departments. The other most important part of the NRT is the chance to meet, work and study with other students who are also working between and across disciplines, so I would hope to preserve events that allow the NRT students to get together, and the presence of our workspaces on campus. I would like the training opportunities to be more explicit and skills focused. I think learning CNS methods are particularly useful, and other kinds of ""general skills training"" (grant writing, mentorship, publishing) can come from the department level and not from the NRT program."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,I think a few workshops for us to share our research skills could be helpful.
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"I worry that the dual mentorship (SICE with other programs/departments) dilutes the quality of research. Or at the very least, my NRT trainees are unclear which area they should be aligned with more closely. Should they focus their research so that it's in line with the training they get from their SICE mentor? Or with their primary mentor? It creates a lot of confusion."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"Interdiciplinary programs are difficult, but it is really helpful for grad students as it gives them access to tools that they would have otherwise not have (singular mentorship in other departments means that you only learn the techniques of your mentor)."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,Interdisciplinary mentorships do not work in some cases. The student simply works with one advisor. In those cases the mentors should be changed or the student should move to one of the programs.
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"Speaking as the past DGS of cognitive science, I hope that CNS and COGS are in constant contact about our joint students."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,Research showcase should be adapted for making sure that each work can get feedback from NRT faculty.
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"As much as the CNS-NRT program tried to involve a diverse set of faculty in jointly solving complex problems, ultimately, in my opinion, the incentives for them to do so were very limited. This is not the program's fault, but an increasing general trend where the only incentive for faculty, especially non-tenured, is to advance their career in the particular field they are in. There is little to no incentive for real transdisciplinary, high-risk research. Here is an idea: a bottom-up approach to defining large and ambitious complex problems. Students (and faculty) would then focus on problems collectively, instead of having students working in isolation and always needing to bridge between their advisors' own interests. Dedicate funding to 'purchase' faculty's time to work on these problems."
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"There's a lot of polishing that need to be done with the programs. It was hard to see what was training in many cases, since it did not feel like there were explicit training opportunities outside of doing our own research. "
2022,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"Unique interdisciplinary opportunities offering promise for new ideas, new collaborations and new knowledge."
2023,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"I am satisfied with most of the program activities. For the interdisciplinary skills training, I am curious of other disciplines' methods (other than the disciplines I am working on), but with limited time, I cannot dive into the depth of them. I am wondering if there is a good way to do this, although I cannot think of a best way. "
2023,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,"I really like the CNS dual-degree programs. I think the one thing i would most strongly recommend be adapted is the interdisciplinary training, though. i want better training in how to present myself as an interdisciplinary researcher in a job market that largely assumes i will be in one department as an academic. it would be helpful to know which institutions are more receptive to interdisciplinarity. can i really get away with not shoe-horning myself into the norms/expectations of one field? if not, then does being interdisciplinary put me at a disadvantage?"
2023,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Group-Qual,I thought all aspects of the program were beneficial and would be useful to future CNS students.
2023,Q160,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Rank-Qual,I have not been presented with affiliate programs. All other programming is satisfactory.
2022,Q162,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Rank-Qual,I think [the NRT Project Manager] role should be filled.
2022,Q162,All Participants,ContinueNRT-Rank-Qual,I really enjoyed my experience as an affiliate and I hope others can get that opportunity in the future.
