As a result, it seems to me like many student's mileage will vary a lot depending entirely on their expectations. If they entered into the program intending to do a degree between two departments that do not play well together, and they expected it to be easier than it is, it would impact their satisfaction. By its nature, this program uses students to cut against departmental norms. I happen to be satisfied because my departments play well together.

It might be helpful to guide the presentation process for students, especially new students. Currently the showcase just feels like a chore, and I never talk to anyone in any meaningful capacity unless they're already working on the project I'm presenting. If the goal is to teach how to present and network, some guidance might be needed, especially for new students. ","I generally have a very negative view of the showcase. I personally don't see it as providing any benefit for students, and I see it largely as a way to show off the students to NSF evaluators. Just to be clear, this would be totally fine if I felt like this goal was being communicated to us honestly. I understand that evaluation is a big part of this program, and if it were honestly pitched to me as a way to show all that we have, I would feel like intentions are clear and honest. It would be a way to rally students to show off. As it is, the annual showcase does not make any sense as a way to benefit students because we spend all our time trying to make our presentations that we generally don't get a chance to even see our peer's work (in-person or online). And because of the interdisciplinary nature of the work, we are forced to cater to too many audiences. Either we pitch too high and no one understands us, or we pitch too low and no one in our field things our work is interesting.

It made me feel like I was part of a much bigger community working towards similar goals. Having all that information presented at once and in an interactive fashion was fantastic!!! It was a bit overwhelming at times- but I would rather be overwhelmed and have the chance to review my notes than miss what others are doing. While I missed being able to interact deeply with the participants (on non-presentation topics and on longer format discussions of the research that might occur at poster session), I loved being able to see everyone present something. There is no way I would have interacted or heard from 30 people during a traditional poster session; this format exposed me to the great breadth of research as well as the various ways to present the material. It was great!! In the future, if possible, I would be interested in a combined format - run 2 minute lighting talks and still have a poster session. That might be impossible - it would be really long - but wow - it was great inspiring to see it all and wonderful to have that sense of community.

Being in Informatics has greatly expanded my understanding and appreciation for the huge number of ways to gather knowledge about the world around us and the human experience. It has been very valuable. Being in CNS and seeing how one can take these ways of gather knowledge and synthesis them via computational and mathematical frameworks and (sometimes) generalize beyond the systems under study has been awesome . The Extended Colloquia also give me constant exposure to people and ideas outside of my area of intense focus and bring in new perspectives and  foster new conceptual connections and maybe most importantly, just keep me grounded in the human meaning and impacts of research.

When you tackle problems within your own subfield you imagine people in other fields have not addressed those issues -- often they have, and there are reasons why no one has done what you thought was easy to do. On the other hand, I feel like I am better informed and closer to making those connections than I was one year ago, and am positive that they are feasible, albeit not necessarily easy.

As for interdisciplinarity in general, I sometimes compare the current days of complex systems science to earlier days of cognitive science. People had discovered this new way of thinking about the mind (computational metaphor), which was a great basis for interdisciplinary work between cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind, AI, and later on neuroscience etc.

In my personal opinion (which is not shared by all cognitive scientists), this promise has somewhat realized in terms of methodological variety; however, like any field, cognitive science is also governed by trends and fads in terms of fashionable research methods and topics, which, in my view, do not necessarily relate to the origins of cognitive science. (E.g. recent focus in social/cultural aspects of cognition.) How strongly should cognitive science then connect to it's origins, given advances in science and changes in perspective, that is debatable; as is whether we should call something cognitive science if it's not the same thing as what was originally defined as cognitive science.

As for complex systems science, I have heard people discussing similar phenomena (e.g. agent-based model fad in the 80's, complex network systems nowadays) and was keen to observe whether/how the CNS-NRT program at IU is able to keep up with interdisciplinarity while not losing connection with trends in complex systems science in general.

I think that, as expected, I saw a lot of focus on complex network systems (relative to other tools that could possibly be used to model similar phenomena), but felt that the program did a great job in terms of incorporating research from different disciplines, using different methods, building towards different kinds of goals. I was also impressed by the open-mindedness of the program in terms of including people (such as me) who do not (at the moment) work directly with complex networks, but are hoping to have applications for complex systems science.

To summarize, 5/5 for walking the walk and not just talking the talk in terms of interdisciplinarity and innovation.

It was very dissappointing experience, because I had been working hard, and have excellent mentorship by both faculty I work with as my advisors/mentors. The comments made towards ""switching"", were the fact that I had dabbled and tried to work with different mentors until I found the right fit. It was not a matter of ""completion of projects"". Many students switch advisors later on in their PhD, which is a much costlier decision that I think the NRT should allow for in the first two years. That would truly highlight such a benefit of the NRT. I think the true affordance here in such a program is to allow students to pursue much more risky decisions, and not necessarily to be ""productive scientists"" off the bat, but build skills that may be overlooked given typical pressures of programs. 

This semester alone, I have submitted a couple abstracts, two papers, and have plans for 3 or 4 more ready for submission by the end of the year. Given the comments made at the last IDP, I do not think they represented me well as a researcher or a student.

There is little to no incentive for real transdisciplinary, high-risk research. Here is an idea: a bottom-up approach to defining large and ambitious complex problems.

Though the specifics of why the groups don't hang out are long, the basic result is that we don't get a chance to talk with cool people about cool things, or get to know each other's research. The poster session helped with this, but it is still difficult to get the social network to connect.

Although I think the complex systems program here is one of the strongest in the country, I still feel like it's hard to find a mentor in complex systems who is willing to give me the space to engage with my subject domain. If CX represents the methodological approach side of the degree, then I feel like the methodologists keep trying to prioritize methods over subject. In my case, since most of the CX faculty here are focused on networks, I often feel like any suggestions or issues I bring up related to social psychology (my domain) are dismissed if it impedes ""just pushing the network model to run"". From their perspective, it doesn't make sense to complicate model parameters or mechanisms if it works well enough to predict data, even if the model is nonsensical from the standpoint of the system they're modeling. 

I think students recognize this. I've heard many times from my fellow NRT trainees that they want to work with one or two particular professors because of their openness and willingness to engage with the subject matter, or at least listen and step out of the way when a student is bringing important content to the project. 

Just for clarification, I'm mostly referring to the professors whose primary departments are CX. The cross-listed professors are probably more likely to feel embedded in their own subject field and thus won't advise people outside of it, which is a different exclusion criterion (eg, a social scientist crosslisted in CX won't take on a student who studies brain networks because of the field difference). ","I'm not sure how you know who my primary mentor is, since my mentor is in my second degree. I'm going to assume this survey isn't about a particular person.

The wording says it's asking about adapting things to CX grad programs, but I don't even know how many CX grad programs there even are. And most of these things are really commonplace across grad programs in general (like getting speakers, showcasing research, having summer funding). 

The only thing I can say is that getting a dual degree is good in concept but in practice it can be a bureaucratic nightmare. It really just uses students as the battering ram to opening doors between departments, which might not be for the benefit of the student. ",,"I really like all my fellow trainees. I think the program did a good job at getting cool people into one place to put forward interesting research. I don't know if this is a consequence or coincidence of the program, but I'm very glad I participated, despite whatever my feelings are about the hiccups with the program. "
