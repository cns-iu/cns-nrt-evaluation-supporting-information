2022,"Fellow","R_1CsgGgOAuRmBlLa","Q155","Also with respect to the previous responses. I feel like the NRT has really dropped the ball this past year. There was minimal support for us, lots of student organizing, which really should not have been the responsibility of students, but provided by the program. To this end, COVID seems to have really stunted the effectiveness of the program, either due to gaps in communication or lack of personnel, or lack of appreciation of personnel, including staff (like [NRT Project Manager], who planned events for us) and students","COVID","Comments"

2022,"Faculty","R_veKLn3a1Wo3q3JL","Q155","I have two NRT students working in my lab (and work with others as part of collaborations). Meeting virtually is not always productive and, in my opinion, has slowed the training of some of these students.","COVID","Comments"
2022,"Fellow","R_29aALr6UIOyxL9D","Q155","All kinds of collaboration became much more difficult- students were no longer sharing workspace or having informal discussions. It was much more difficult to get in touch with professors, the virtual colloquia didn't allow for any kind of informal discussion (besides which there were just many fewer of them). The planned trips to visit other NRT programs were cancelled. The whole program had to be restructured and I think that was difficult for everyone, moving from a structure that was planned to one that was improvised. People in general retreated to their separate departments and the interdisciplinary spirit of the program was difficult to sustain. ","COVID","Comments"

2022,"Fellow","R_2DTfQ9ISl6WKWAJ","Q155","I get the impression that the lecture series, which was a bulk of NRT participation before the pandemic, was severely impacted by the pandemic and people's willingness to travel. This is understandable, but it means that newer NRT students basically did not get an NRT experience. I have put in some effort to getting to know newer students, and they make up a bulk of my current social circle. They have talked about how the money is great but there doesn't seem to be an NRT program, and I've expressed my own experience to them about how things were different before COVID. 

This also means that there is a massive empty space between the social groups of the older and younger NRT students, where the younger students generally don't feel like they know any older students and vice versa. Though the specifics of why the groups don't hang out are long, the basic result is that we don't get a chance to talk with cool people about cool things, or get to know each other's research. The poster session helped with this, but it is still difficult to get the social network to connect. ","COVID","Comments"

2022,"Fellow","R_24uUR9Mm5yALLAF","Q155","Because I joined during the pandemic, I feel like many of my options were very limited, including interacting with other NRT students, talking with visiting speakers, getting to know NRT-affiliated faculty, and exploring my research options.

2022,"Fellow","R_1CsgGgOAuRmBlLa","Q160","There's a lot of polishing that need to be done with the programs. It was hard to see what was training in many cases, since it did not feel like there were explicit training opportunities outside of doing our own research. ","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Affiliate","R_3fW2vM8qlcLDMKh","Q160","As much as the CNS-NRT program tried to involve a diverse set of faculty in jointly solving complex problems, ultimately, in my opinion, the incentives for them to do so were very limited. This is not the program's fault, but an increasing general trend where the only incentive for faculty, especially non-tenured, is to advance their career in the particular field they are in. There is little to no incentive for real transdisciplinary, high-risk research. Here is an idea: a bottom-up approach to defining large and ambitious complex problems. Students (and faculty) would then focus on problems collectively, instead of having students working in isolation and always needing to bridge between their advisors' own interests. Dedicate funding to 'purchase' faculty's time to work on these problems.","ContinueNRT","Explain"

2022,"Fellow","R_3EXZT5Y0KtZcdiG","Q160","Interdiciplinary programs are difficult, but it is really helpful for grad students as it gives them access to tools that they would have otherwise not have (singular mentorship in other departments means that you only learn the techniques of your mentor). ","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Faculty","R_veKLn3a1Wo3q3JL","Q160","I worry that the dual mentorship (SICE with other programs/departments) dilutes the quality of research. Or at the very least, my NRT trainees are unclear which area they should be aligned with more closely. Should they focus their research so that it's in line with the training they get from their SICE mentor? Or with their primary mentor? It creates a lot of confusion.","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Fellow","R_21uN0kEmSBIUnri","Q160","I think a few workshops for us to share our research skills could be helpful.","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Fellow","R_29aALr6UIOyxL9D","Q160","I think the opportunity to enroll in a dual-degree program is the most important part and I hope that remains something that IU supports- few other schools have this kind of support for that option of being in two departments. The other most important part of the NRT is the chance to meet, work and study with other students who are also working between and across disciplines, so I would hope to preserve events that allow the NRT students to get together, and the presence of our workspaces on campus. I would like the training opportunities to be more explicit and skills focused. I think learning CNS methods are particularly useful, and other kinds of ""general skills training"" (grant writing, mentorship, publishing) can come from the department level and not from the NRT program.","ContinueNRT","Explain"

2022,"Fellow","R_2DTfQ9ISl6WKWAJ","Q160","I don't feel like I understand this page. The wording says it's asking about adapting things to CX grad programs, but I don't even know how many CX grad programs there even are. And most of these things are really commonplace across grad programs in general (like getting speakers, showcasing research, having summer funding). 

The only thing I can say is that getting a dual degree is good in concept but in practice it can be a bureaucratic nightmare. It really just uses students as the battering ram to opening doors between departments, which might not be for the benefit of the student. ","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Affiliate","R_3RxSgoFhVREJcLn","Q160","It was never fully clear what the interdisciplinary mentorship should encompass for affiliates. Since we don't take classes in complex systems, it's not as easy to forge strong mentorship relations with faculty.","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Fellow","R_a60D5VY6O8G3q0h","Q160","The showcase has historically seemed largely pointless as we never get feedback on our projects (esp. virtual showcases). The colloquium speakers have rarely appealed to me. ","ContinueNRT","Explain"
2022,"Fellow","R_24uUR9Mm5yALLAF","Q160","As mentioned earlier, I think the colloquium series should be adapted to include speakers who don't have a physics background. The NRT doesn't provide the training for us to fully understand what a physicist does, even one in complex systems, so it feels like a waste of my time to go to talks I barely understand by people whose trajectory through complex systems looks nothing like mine.  I also think the CNS research skills and training opportunities should be adapted, for a similar reason. I feel like the program is lacking in rigorous methodological training, which is really important to me to have. This was present in YY's network science class, but such training should not be limited to one class.","ContinueNRT","Explain"

2022,"Faculty","R_1FQ9qFRHuqFgeD3","Q160","We will need to keep activities in hybrid format [in person + virtual] for the near future as we navigate the successive waves of COVID infections. This is not going away. Lab experiences etc. will need to be adapted - perhaps training video materials  will need to be made. Similarly, talks will likely be harder to do. The NRT program could also consider more overseas speakers for colloquia & make them online - let's make lemonade out of lemons. They cannot travel easily, so let's bring them to us virtually!","ContinueNRT","Explain"

2023,"Fellow","R_1jqCYqgeF4ZtYA0","Q160","i really like the CNS dual-degree programs. i think the one thing i would most strongly recommend be adapted is the interdisciplinary training, though. i want better training in how to present myself as an interdisciplinary researcher in a job market that largely assumes i will be in one department as an academic. it would be helpful to know which institutions are more receptive to interdisciplinarity. can i really get away with not shoe-horning myself into the norms/expectations of one field? if not, then does being interdisciplinary put me at a disadvantage?","ContinueNRT","Explain"

2020,"Fellow","R_1DIlhW4uER6lAjP","Q107","The strength of the NRT program is in the student community that formed around it. The actual courses have been, in my experience, quite weak. My discussion courses have been unproductive and largely driven by a few men who make it nearly impossible for women to chime in.

2021,"Fellow","R_3MsSpbyAYmgbRYg","Q107","The funding for international students is really bad and we miss out on a lot of funding opportunities that US citizens have. Being on the NRT fellowship left me in a position where I experienced significant financial hardship. There was also no way to generate additional income because the fellowship restricts us from working as a research assistant. I don't see any differences in terms of mentoring but being an international student in this program feels like being a second-class participant whose work is valued much less than of my American peers considering how much less we get paid despite the same expectations.

2021,"Fellow","R_3KPL0Di1lY4XOtA","Q133","In my experience, the NRT by its nature puts strains on the current silo'd bureaucracies represented in departments. As a result, it seems to me like many student's mileage will vary a lot depending entirely on their expectations. If they entered into the program intending to do a degree between two departments that do not play well together, and they expected it to be easier than it is, it would impact their satisfaction. By its nature, this program uses students to cut against departmental norms. I happen to be satisfied because my departments play well together. That isn't an indication of the program, though, because the program has relatively little leverage in pushing a department to accept certain students or work with them in ways that make sense for the student.

2022,"Fellow","R_2DTfQ9ISl6WKWAJ","Q27T","I don't know how helpful this is as a generalized critique of mentorship, but I'd like to express some issues I've been facing over the course of my time here. 

Although I think the complex systems program here is one of the strongest in the country, I still feel like it's hard to find a mentor in complex systems who is willing to give me the space to engage with my subject domain. If CX represents the methodological approach side of the degree, then I feel like the methodologists keep trying to prioritize methods over subject. In my case, since most of the CX faculty here are focused on networks, I often feel like any suggestions or issues I bring up related to social psychology (my domain) are dismissed if it impedes ""just pushing the network model to run"". From their perspective, it doesn't make sense to complicate model parameters or mechanisms if it works well enough to predict data, even if the model is nonsensical from the standpoint of the system they're modeling. 

I think students recognize this. I've heard many times from my fellow NRT trainees that they want to work with one or two particular professors because of their openness and willingness to engage with the subject matter, or at least listen and step out of the way when a student is bringing important content to the project. 

Just for clarification, I'm mostly referring to the professors whose primary departments are CX. The cross-listed professors are probably more likely to feel embedded in their own subject field and thus won't advise people outside of it, which is a different exclusion criterion (eg, a social scientist crosslisted in CX won't take on a student who studies brain networks because of the field difference).

It was very dissappointing experience, because I had been working hard, and have excellent mentorship by both faculty I work with as my advisors/mentors. The comments made towards ""switching"", were the fact that I had dabbled and tried to work with different mentors until I found the right fit. It was not a matter of ""completion of projects"". Many students switch advisors later on in their PhD, which is a much costlier decision that I think the NRT should allow for in the first two years. That would truly highlight such a benefit of the NRT. I think the true affordance here in such a program is to allow students to pursue much more risky decisions, and not necessarily to be ""productive scientists"" off the bat, but build skills that may be overlooked given typical pressures of programs. 

This semester alone, I have submitted a couple abstracts, two papers, and have plans for 3 or 4 more ready for submission by the end of the year. Given the comments made at the last IDP, I do not think they represented me well as a researcher or a student. I think the NRT funding allowing me to take more risks and be more careful with my decision, was the biggest benefit I had, allowing me to pursue research like I do now, with the mentors I have chosen now.","Mentorship","Comments"

I realized that even the speakers who tackle the same subject as I, bring perspectives that can completely diverge from my own. This is not just a matter of different results or different methods, but even different questions being asked.","Interdisciplinary","Comments"
2021,"Fellow","R_2xQrWnrmpAEkcSp","Q147","""I enjoy tackling the challenges posed by working on complex problems, even if doing so requires me to expend extra time and effort."" - I certainly enjoy this but that doesn't mean I have the time to do it. 

""I am willing to invest the time required for learning about fields that are different from my own"" - I see this when I participate in the Extended Colloquia. That doesn't mean that I actually have the time/resources to do this beyond the colloquia. Sometimes even active participation in the colloquia is a stretch. I am willing to do this - but I still have limits. 

Being in Informatics has greatly expanded my understanding and appreciation for the huge number of ways to gather knowledge about the world around us and the human experience. It has been very valuable. Being in CNS and seeing how one can take these ways of gather knowledge and synthesis them via computational and mathematical frameworks and (sometimes) generalize beyond the systems under study has been awesome . The Extended Colloquia also give me constant exposure to people and ideas outside of my area of intense focus and bring in new perspectives and  foster new conceptual connections and maybe most importantly, just keep me grounded in the human meaning and impacts of research.

I am less hopeful for interdisciplinary work in academics because the incentive structures in the academy is not focused on a common goal associated with the problem at hand, rather the goals are associated with funding and publications.

2021,"Affiliate","R_3l23x8DLlYa6avn","Q147","As for my own research, while I used to think that my work has direct methodologial applications for complex systems science, through my NRT experience I have learned that it's not that easy. When you tackle problems within your own subfield you imagine people in other fields have not addressed those issues -- often they have, and there are reasons why no one has done what you thought was easy to do. On the other hand, I feel like I am better informed and closer to making those connections than I was one year ago, and am positive that they are feasible, albeit not necessarily easy.

As for interdisciplinarity in general, I sometimes compare the current days of complex systems science to earlier days of cognitive science. People had discovered this new way of thinking about the mind (computational metaphor), which was a great basis for interdisciplinary work between cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind, AI, and later on neuroscience etc.

In my personal opinion (which is not shared by all cognitive scientists), this promise has somewhat realized in terms of methodological variety; however, like any field, cognitive science is also governed by trends and fads in terms of fashionable research methods and topics, which, in my view, do not necessarily relate to the origins of cognitive science. (E.g. recent focus in social/cultural aspects of cognition.) How strongly should cognitive science then connect to it's origins, given advances in science and changes in perspective, that is debatable; as is whether we should call something cognitive science if it's not the same thing as what was originally defined as cognitive science.

As for complex systems science, I have heard people discussing similar phenomena (e.g. agent-based model fad in the 80's, complex network systems nowadays) and was keen to observe whether/how the CNS-NRT program at IU is able to keep up with interdisciplinarity while not losing connection with trends in complex systems science in general.

I think that, as expected, I saw a lot of focus on complex network systems (relative to other tools that could possibly be used to model similar phenomena), but felt that the program did a great job in terms of incorporating research from different disciplines, using different methods, building towards different kinds of goals. I was also impressed by the open-mindedness of the program in terms of including people (such as me) who do not (at the moment) work directly with complex networks, but are hoping to have applications for complex systems science.

To summarize, 5/5 for walking the walk and not just talking the talk in terms of interdisciplinarity and innovation.

2022,"Fellow","R_1CsgGgOAuRmBlLa","Q147","As mentioned, the NRT has given me the funding to pursue more risky decisions -- so from that point of view, it has allowed me to really invest in interdisciplanarity. Some programs with the colloquium series have helped too. That being said, the overall NRT program internally hasn't made that much of an impact. It really has been my mentors, plus the affordance to take risks, along with colloquium that has allowed this.","Interdisciplinary","Comments"
